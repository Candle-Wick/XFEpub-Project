This is my university capstone project. It is software that exists for turning an online resource, a story hosted on a XenForo based forum, into an E-book for download. 

Their are 3 versions each hosted on a different branch.

CL-version is designed to work on the command line, executing inside the terminal.
Main is a version designed to work on the browser- being hypothetically hosted somewhere. It should require small modifications to function properly.
NoDeploy is the version of main I used to test its functionality on the browser.
