    <h2>Flashback 2</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">The conversation had turned political after Olivia's revelation. It was, basically, inevitable. They had to decide, as the acting rulers of the islands, how they were going to handle the entire new world that had opened up to them suddenly. None of them were happy about it, but all of them knew they had to do it, even Nanu.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm just saying, acting isolationist at the beginning isn't the most unreasonable behavior," Nanu said, *We don't know what-"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever he was going to say was cut off by an Ultra Wormhole opening in the center of the round table, causing all four Kahuna to jump up and reach for their aces. Hariyama, Lycanroc, Mudsdale and Alolan Persian came out in a flash of light and tensing muscles.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then Izuku came spilling out of the portal and onto the table, a scared look in his eyes as he scrambled over to Olivia and threw himself at her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"What is it, keiki?" Olivia said, voice soft as she ran a hand through the hair of the shaking boy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I woke up and there was a weird guy in my bedroom, he'd picked me up. And then Mimikyu and Blanket started fighting him and Mom came in and told me to come to you because she wanted be somewhere safe, and, and-"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Sounds like a kidnapping," Nanu said, staring at the Wormhole like he was thinking something over. Finally he said, "Ah, screw it, Hala, you mind coming with me? I want to make sure the kidnapper doesn't take it out on the kid's mom. If we're gonna cause an interdimensional shockwave either way, might as well do it with a bang, eh?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I was going to go through either way," Hala said, already halfway on the table.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, then, let's go, Persian," Nanu climbed up onto the table, his Pokemon hoping up right after him, "Olivia, you stay with the kid, he needs you right now."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia nodded, running her hand through Izuku's hair and murmuring words of comfort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kaitou finally threw the little bastard off his shoulder, blood leaking down it and staining his back. He quickly ducked a swing from the ghost and ran towards the portal, just in time for someone to come out of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That… was a large man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I take it you're the kidnapper?" The man said, planting a heavy hand on Kaitou's shoulder. He stepped out of the portal, pushing Kaitou back as he did, and out came a lanky man with a cat the size of a large dog.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Can't say we approve of that," the lanky man said, "and, oh, is that a Larvitar on an Outrage? How many times has the little bastard bit you?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Once," Kaitou spat, feeling the fingers dig into the bite wound.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Too bad," the man smirked, and Kaitou felt his stomach drop as he tried to merge with the shadows instinctively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All it got him, quite literally, was a bite in the ass. The "little bastard" in question lunged forwards, fangs digging into his left buttcheek. Kaitou roared in pain and made a sweep at the thing, fingers cracking against the rocky hide and failing to knock him off. Then the Ghost appeared in front of him, eyes glaring a bright red before it cracked the stick into his skull so hard he saw stars.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You know, of all the kidnappers I've dealt with over the years, of course most of them are Pokenappers really, you are by far the, uh, most pitiful," Lanky said, "Sorry for having you come through the Wormhole, Hala. Honestly thought this was gonna be a bigger problem then it ended up being."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"It's quite alright, Nanu," the large one, Hala, said, "You didn't know, and it's always better to be safe than sorry, let's sit and wait for the police to arrive at least."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before Kaitou could do anything, the stick smashed into his temple and he finally, mercifully, blacked out. He never should have taken this job, even if it was the Quirk Thief asking. Better Quirkless than savaged and in jail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
"Acerola," Nanu called into the Aether House, waiting for the seven year old to come rushing down the halls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She did, her homemade, patchwork dress flowing and Mimikins floating behind her, "Yes, Uncle Nanu?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I want to introduce you to a new friend," Nanu said, crouching down, "He's gonna have a rough time, so I want you to help take good care of him, ok?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ok," Acerola nodded, turning to the door that opened, letting in Olivia and the boy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Acerola stared at her new friend for a second, before squealing and pointing at his head, "You have a Mimikyu too!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, sitting on his head was the familiar frame of oa Mimikyu covered by their Pikachu disguise. The boy glanced up before looking down and smiling shyly, "You do too! Why's yours all gray and stuff?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Because Mimikins is a Shiny Pokemon," Acerola explained, "They're rare Pokemon that are different colors from normal ones. What's your's name?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I, uh, I haven't given it one yet," the boy looked up at it, "How about… uh… I dunno… how about you name it?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You'd let me?" Acerola said with a gasp, clapping her hands together, "That's a big thing, you know!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, yeah I'd let you," the boy said, "I'm Izuku by the way, Izuku Midoriya."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Acerola," Acerola curtsied, realizing Mimikins was translating what they were saying using its ghostly powers, "Now, for a name… hmm, how about Pikakyu?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Pikakyu?" Izuku looked up at his Mimikyu, "Do you like that, buddy, Pikakyu?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pikakyu carefully maneuvered the head so it nodded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Pikakyu it is then," Izuku said brightly, smiling at Acerola, "What do you wanna do?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Want to read a scary story together?" Acerola asked, smiling at him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Short, but hopefully to the point. Thoughts, questions opinions? Good? Bad? Meh?</div>
