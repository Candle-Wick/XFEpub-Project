<div class="bbWrapper">— X Five Years Ago X—<br/>
<br/>
Inko watched Izuku happily feed berries to the "omen of death", him practically cooing over the little thing as it snatched up the berry and pulled it into the shadows of its cloak and creating loud munching noises. His green eyes sparkled with joy as he sat on the couch with Blanket, who was eating his way through a popcorn bowl full of sand from Olivia. Turning her eyes onto Olivia, she tried to wrap her mind around what was going on, "So, Izuku doesn't just open portals to other countries…"<br/>
<br/>
"...He opens portals to other worlds," Olivia finished, nodding. <br/>
<br/>
"Oh," Inko said, not really sure what else to say.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, it's… it's a pickle," Olivia sighed, twirling a finger in her hair and petting a small dog pokemon with one hand. The Pokemon playfully nibbled at her hand, and she sighed, tugging the finger from its mouth and going back to petting it, "Normally, I'd say we should keep this between ourselves. Something like this, if it got out, would shake both our worlds to its core. <i>We've</i> known about other dimensions, but all evidence pointed towards there only being powerful Pokemon in them, if there's ever been a case of this before, I haven't been informed. From what you've said, you didn't know alternate dimensions existed?"<br/>
<br/>
"I… it was always something fictional, like a book or a movie. We've never had actual, honest evidence of them existing. This is… is…"<br/>
<br/>
"Revolutionary. Every Professor worth their degree on both sides of Ultra Space is gonna want a look at him," Olivia said seriously, "It changes everything, quite literally, over night."<br/>
<br/>
"You said normally you'd want to keep this quiet," Inko said, "is this because of-"<br/>
<br/>
"Faba," Olivia agreed grimly, "There's no way he's just going to just sit by with the knowledge that Izuku exists. He's gonna tell the leader of the Aether Foundation, Lusamine. And while I have a good relationship with the Foundation, her and Faba have always been a little too obsessed with Ultra Wormholes for anyone's own good."<br/>
<br/>
"So, what do we do?" Inko asked, eyes turning to Izuku who was laying on the couch with Blanket on one side and the Mimikyu on the other, hand wrapped around the costume's neck like a teddy bear and other gripping a shadowed hand from underneath the costume.<br/>
<br/>
Great. Another one.<br/>
<br/>
"So we just tell everyone?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's probably the best way to keep him safe, unfortunately," Olivia said, voice grim again, ,"With Professors Oak, Elm, Rowan, and others wanting to get a look at him, Aether can't manipulate him all the time. I can offer some protection, but sooner or later Aether will get their hands on him."<br/>
<br/>
Inko breathed in, looking at Izuku.<br/>
<br/>
"Ok, let's do this."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Olivia sailed to the small island located as close to equidistant from all four of the major Alola Islands as possible, a worn manor on it. Once, it had belonged to one of the Alolan kings. Now, it mostly acted as a home to Ghost-Types, but occasionally, when necessary it became a meeting place for the four Kahuna. <br/>
<br/>
Today it was acting as such, the damaged dock already playing host to three boats, Aliʻi standing there with his cane and Mudsdale, eyes staring at Olivia as she dropped anchor and got out of the boat.<br/>
<br/>
"Nanu isn't happy about the sudden call," He said, using his cane to walk along with her, the oldest Kahuna and the youngest, "I suspect he wouldn't have bothered to show up at all, if the Guardians hadn't met and then Tapu Bulu hadn't begun to harass him. If you don't want a particularly blistering tongue lashing from him, you'll have a very, very good reason for calling us here today, young Olivia."<br/>
<br/>
"I do, kumu," Olivia said as they entered the manor and took their seats at tables pointing towards their islands.<br/>
<br/>
"Have a good reason?" Nanu said, "Let's hear it, kid."<br/>
<br/>
"Yesterday, while doing a routine check of the Diglett cave, I came across a boy," Olivia started, before heaving a sigh, "A boy who came through an Ultra Wormhole. About Acerola and Hau's age."<br/>
<br/>
Silence like a wall fell between the four Kahuna, before, surprisingly, Nanu cut it with a proverbial knife.<br/>
<br/>
"He can stay with me for a while, if you don't want to take care of him. At least until we find a place to foster him full time," he said, "Does he remember anything? Name? Birthday? Parents?"<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
"All of the above," Olivia said, "No, the thing that makes this weird, and something we need to discuss, is that this kid can open Ultra Wormholes at will. Him and his Mom are back in their homeworld, doing some paperwork to identify it because instead of Pokemon, they have people with superpowers. And this kid's, just to repeat, is to open Ultra Wormholes."<br/>
<br/>
The silence got thicker, and then Hala spoke, "I assume you're telling us this, because hiding it has become untenable, Kahuna Olivia?"<br/>
<br/>
Oh, boy, they were pulling out the big boy titles. This was no longer a fun, if unnecessary meeting between the Kahuna, it was of vital importance.<br/>
<br/>
"Faba was spying on us as he came through," Olivia said.<br/>
<br/>
"So Aether knows," Nanu said, "Why do we put up with them again?"<br/>
<br/>
"The Aether Foundation has done much in the way of environment protection and restoration," Aliʻi argued.<br/>
<br/>
"They're also obsessed with Ultra Wormholes, which is gonna end with someone dead," Nanu said before pausing, "Might already have, nobody's seen Mohn in months."<br/>
<br/>
"So we have a boy who revolutionizes Dimensional Theory," Hala said, "An unknown society with unknown powers, and Aether is interested in them."<br/>
<br/>
Olivia nodded, "We figured it was best to put everything on the table and reveal it to the world. Keep Aether from being able to hog the kid. Worst comes to worst, he sees different nations, best comes to best, people come over here to examine him. But I wanted to check with you to see if you had any protests."<br/>
<br/>
"Nothing particular on my end," Ali'i said.<br/>
<br/>
"We sure the kid is gonna want that attention, or be able to stand it? Nanu said, "We're gonna have everyone and their cousin jumping over them to watch the kid. I get we don't have a choice, but I don't want us dealing with some egotistical shitstain in ten years time because it went to his head, and I also don't want him turning into a nervous wreck because of them."<br/>
<br/>
"That's why I'm gonna help take care of him," Olivia said, finality in her voice.<br/>
<br/>
"And we're gonna have to act in our official capacity as the Island Kings and Queens," Ali'i said, using the other title for Kahuna, "To this meeting between worlds. I'm certain the Guardians are aware of that, if they called us all here."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Kaitou slipped into his shadow and moved under the doorframe, coming out to unlock the door after looking around to make sure nobody was awake and haunting the apartment in the middle of the night. Once he was sure he was fine, he made his way to the room with a childish All Might sign and slipped under that just as easily.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Ten Million. No hero was gonna be here to save you this time. Wasn't anything personal, but ten million yen for a simple kidnapping was a lot of money. No idea why whatever freak wanted a five year old for that much, but it wasn't his job to ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
He unmerged with his shadow by the window, opening it and letting the cool night air into the room. Turning towards the boy, he came face to face with the <i>thing</i> that would make his night a living hell. It was sitting on the desk, barely twenty centimeters tall.<br/>
<br/>
At first, he mistook it for a morbid children's stuffed toy, woven together from rags. So much so that he reached for Ten Million without paying attention to it. Had the boy in both arms and was lifting him in the air when he came face to face with it floating in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
 Kaitou took a step back from it, only for it to float forwards, eye flashing from two holes in the torso,and dark energy raising off of it as it gave a loud, croaking, "<i>Mimikyu!</i>"<br/>
<br/>
"Tar?" The other creature lying in the bed sat up and stared at them in confusion for a second. Causing the boy to wake up.<br/>
<br/>
"Wha- who are you, put me down!" The boy called, beginning to struggle in his arms. <br/>
<br/>
The imp rolled its lips back in anger and purple energy began to rise from from the corners of it's mouth, "TAR!?"<br/>
<br/>
Kaitou heard a door open, and a tired sigh came from that direction, spinning towards the window only to find the rag floating in front of him again. Green energy began to build from the stick floating with it,and Kaitou swallowed.<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
Blanket was woken by Mimikyu's croaking yell, sitting up and immediately noticing dad wasn't next to him. Where was dad-?<br/>
<br/>
He blinked as he realized that a man wearing a black shirt and pants was holding dad, Mimikyu floating in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
"Tar?" He asked, sitting up. Was it a friend? <i>Dad?</i><br/>
<br/>
Dad woke up, looking around in confusion, "Wha- who are you, put me down."<br/>
<br/>
Not a friend! Definitely not a friend!<br/>
<br/>
Blanket climbed up, his Outrage building into purple flames at the corner of his mouth, "TAR!"<br/>
<br/>
Mimikyu lunged forwards, her stick smacking the man in the face and sending him stumbling back into the bed, where Blanket lunged forwards and clamped his jaws around his shoulder, causing the man to jerk forward with a scream of pain. Blanket refused to let go, hanging off the man as purple fire burned around the bite.<br/>
<br/>
"What's going on- who are you!?" Dad's Mom said, opening the door, "What are you doing in my house, what are you doing with my son!?"<br/>
<br/>
"Mom!" Dad rolled out of the man's arms, dodging the pained grab that just caused Blanket to tighten his jaw grip tight enough that a iron-y taste flowed into his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
"Keep him busy, Blanket, Mimikyu, I'm calling the cops!" Dad's Mom said, rushing from the room, "Izuku, go see Olivia!"<br/>
<br/>
"But-!"<br/>
<br/>
"Just do as I say, now! I need you to be somewhere safe!" Dad's Mom said, and Dad punched a hole in the air and vanished into it as the man dove at him, only for Mimikyu to fly in front of him and smash his face with her glowing green stick.<br/>
