    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p/>
    <div> <div> <div><div class="bbWrapper">Reincarnation is a bitch. Or at least, it is in my limited experience.<br/> <br/> I found myself in a baby�s body, half-blind, barely able to move, my lungs ripping out in a scream, my skin raw and cold. My last memory was a gunshot. No dignified truck-kun exit for me. Just walking through a mall and suddenly I was exiting a womb, an experience I do not recommend remembering.<br/> <br/> It took time for me to rebuild my mind. Months. I had the mind of a grown man, pushing through the synapses of a newborn. My first moments were trying to move. Then I had to get over the undignified act of breastfeeding from a woman I didn�t know, which couldn�t have been weird.<br/> <br/> Mom and Dad. They were nothing like my last set. Arabian still, but from Egypt rather than Morocco. And they were British. Which made sense. Because everyone around me was.<br/> <br/> It was a travesty. A red-blooded American, born in London and living in Surrey. Newborns, as it turns out, have the brain capacity for annoyance. Or at least, I did.<br/> <br/> Months, a full couple of years really, of rebuilding myself, mind and body. You never think about how hard the simple act of movement is for babies. Getting from lying on my back to crawling around took four months. And it was boring. <br/> <br/> Also, apparently my name was Gareth Ahmed this time. Gareth. Wow. What a name.<br/> <br/> My mom and dad were sweethearts, always keeping an eye on me, teaching me what they could. I tried my best to work with them, laughing the way a baby should at certain things. I did throw in some annoying bits. It sucked, waking them up at night. But I didn�t know what else I could do?<br/> <br/> I wasn�t exactly Anos Voldigoad, born talking like a grown ass man. I had to exercise my throat, stretch out my vocals and practice them. So I couldn�t explain, �hey, mom and dad, this ain�t my first go around on the Earth and I really don�t consider you my mom and dad.�<br/> <br/> I felt like an asshole for feeling that way. But they were more akin to a pair of very nice people I liked. I couldn�t mentally just replace them with my own parents. I didn�t even try. It was just so weird and it made me feel guilty as sin.<br/> <br/> Why had it happened? Why did I just get brain shuffled into this body? What was the reason? I should have been in the afterlife, or just gone in a black void. Getting all the great answers.<br/> <br/> Instead I was trying to convince my body that solid food was good. I was so goddamn tired of baby food�<br/> <br/> I enjoyed having brand new eyes and an unscarred body of course. Everything was so clear, and I had none of the aches and pains that grow in you as you become an adult. <br/> <br/> Years passed. Plus side of being an adult in a child's body, you can funnel your eternal energy into full on projects. I slept, ate, and worked out. Well, close to it as I could. At first it was just me trying to stop feeling like I was useless. But by the time I turned four I was exercising as much as I could. I was speaking around 9 months and graduated to actual sentences by fourteen, though I held back as much as possible. <br/> <br/> It was impossible to be entirely normal though. My parents noticed that I wasn�t a normal newborn quick. I was too focused. I was too quick on the uptake, and I didn�t freak out the way little kids often did. <br/> <br/> When I was four, they sent me to a therapist. Or as they said, �a very nice man who wants to talk to you!�<br/> <br/> Like I said. Sweethearts. My mom was pregnant at the time. In my last life, I�d had five siblings by the time I was a teen. I wondered if that was going to be replicated here.<br/> <br/> I spoke to the therapist for around an hour. When we left, he officially called me a sociopath. I called him a quack and told my parents I wasn�t going to deal with someone like that again if I could help it.<br/> <br/> Still, after that they seemed to treat me differently. I didn�t mind it. I was a better kid to them than I had been to my real parents, I�m sad to say. Cleaned up after myself, ate my food, and eventually watched out for my baby brother, Ali. Funny, I had a cousin with the same name in my last life.<br/> <br/> Still, you can�t live as an adult in a child�s body without other kids noticing how weird you are. The kid who spends time reading, working out, and acts like an old man rather than getting pulled into classroom politics gets noticed.<br/> <br/> And don�t tell me it isn�t politics. Kids may be rudimentary at it, but they�re as cutthroat as any real life Senator. Or a House of Lord guy? Whatever the British version was, I didn�t care.<br/> <br/> Anyways, after my new body turned 6 and I was in my second year of school was when I got into my first fight in school. Some kid pushing his weight around. I tossed him on his back and held him down until the teacher separated us. Nothing serious. I wasn�t about to really fight a kid.<br/> <br/> He came back with some more subtle bullying. Or subtle in his mind. Racism mostly. I let it go up until he insulted my fake mom.<br/> <br/> I held him an arm bar after school and walked him through why it was wrong to treat others the way he had. <br/> <br/> Kid backed off, and I gained a reputation for being a delinquent. Never mind the facts, I�d threatened to break someone's arm for being disrespectful. Ha! Kids are cute.<br/> <br/> Of course, my somewhat peaceful life ended at 9 years old when I eventually got transferred to a new school. St. Grogory's Primary School. If you recognize the name, good on you, because I didn�t.<br/> <br/> I was reborn in 1980. The only reason that matter to me was that I was making plans to invest in various companies down the road. I didn�t consider that an important year.<br/> <br/> So when I entered St. Grogory's and stood in a classroom as my teacher introduced me to my class, that was the first time the pieces came together. Because of a single kid in the back of the class.<br/> <br/> He was skinny as hell, painfully so, and practically swimming in clothing too big for him. His glasses were large and round, on top of a pair of extremely green eyes. And under his bowl cut hair, I could barely see a lightning bolt shaped scar.<br/> <br/> I kept control of my face despite the emotions broiling in me. But when the teacher told me to take a seat, I moved into one of the empty seats next to the kid. Next to Harry Potter.<br/> <br/> I wasn�t reincarnated, I was isekai�d. Into one of the most common ones to get isekai�d into. Goddamnit. I needed to get a gun asap.<br/> <br/> As the teacher began to drone on and Harry Potter kept his head down, I bemoaned my fate silently next to him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <hr class="bbc-hr bbc-hr--3"><br/> <br/> <br/> Nine years of work, and none of it was enough. Harry Potter (the universe, not the kid) wasn�t a death world or anything, but it was certainly way too dangerous for a kid. I�d been working out and learning as much as I could, and I was certainly stronger and smarter than any kid my age should have been. My parents hadn�t been able to afford martial arts lessons, but I�d practiced on my own as best as I could.<br/> <br/> None of it mattered. A 9 year old can�t punch faster than a wand can unleash magic.<br/> <br/> Maybe I should have been more freaked out at the prospect of being in a fictional world? Then again, I�d been in a weird situation for a while anyways. Plus, I probably had nothing to worry about. It was likely that I didn�t have any magic. I�d never shown any signs of accidental magic.<br/> <br/> Never turned a jumper into a tent, changed a teacher's hair color, or summoned a steamroller.<br/> <br/> God, of all universes, why Harry Potter? Magic made no <i>sense</i> in this universe. The forces of the universe beholden to the wave of a magical wand made sense. But why did you have to be so specific with the words and movement? Did magic just have a bunch of locks that wizards figured out through trial and error how to open? <br/> <br/> Give the Last Airbender or Fullmetal Alchemist. Way doper, with more understandable magical systems.<br/> <br/> And I really hoped I didn�t have magic. Part of my plan depended on taking the internet by storm. Having that ruined by magic�s inability to work with tech would suck. Or was that just the other Harry wizard?<br/> <br/> I was so in my own head that it wasn�t until the bell rang for lunch that I remembered one of the other people involved in all of this. Harry Potter flinched at the sound of the bell. He looked terrified. Before anyone else could move, the kid had packed his bag and ran for the door. I put my own stuff away more sedately. <br/> <br/> Harry had a hell of a life before him. By the time he turned what, thirteen? He�d face more life or death situations than some police officers and firefighters would in their whole existence. The fact he�d grown up to be a well adjusted adult was more unrealistic than the dragons and centaurs.<br/> <br/> Did that matter to me though? I knew he�d be okay. He�d be great even, get married to Ginny, have a bunch of kids, do� something that happened in that play I�d never seen, and stay friends with Ron and Hermione for the rest of his life. <br/> <br/> Better to worry about myself. I had a second chance at life, I needed to take it. Keep my body healthy, keep learning as much as possible, make tons of cash. It was a simple plan, and one the magical world need not intrude in.<br/> <br/> Some folk would die. Fred, Dobby, Dumbledore� goddamnit, what was I supposed to do about those? What <i>could</i> I do damnit?<br/> <br/> That thought haunted me. I�d have to be crazy not to feel guilt for possibly being able to stop those deaths and not doing anything. But fuckin�<br/> <br/> I used to be a really cheery dude. Months of shitting myself involuntarily, being treated like a dumb invalid for years, followed by being looked at like a freak for being an adult in a kids body had really turned me into a grumpy asshole.<br/> <br/> The question of what the fuck I was supposed to do with my new realization of reality was interrupted by the sight of a small whale in school clothes huffing and puffing as it passed. I stared at it, ignoring the skinny kids following it, before I realized what I was looking at.<br/> <br/> Good god. Dudley Dursley was going to have a heart attack before he turned 10. The kid looked like he would roll if I pushed him over. Folds of fat under his clothes, beady eyes set in a face like an obese Cabbage Patch Kids, and a flop of blonde hair. <br/> <br/> Then his grin registered. No one that young should have looked that sadistic. I followed him and his cronies, calmly pulling an apple from my backpack and chowing on it as I did.<br/> <br/> The group of four ran across the courtyard, looking around. I noticed other kids moving away from them. Well well, look who had gained a rep for being dangerous. That was adorable. Every kid in the group was about as tough as a� well, a nine year old. <br/> <br/> I kept my distance, watching them rush around with a purpose. I saw him before they did. Harry was running from one hall to another, spinning the corner. Hm�<br/> <br/> The smart thing to do was to ignore it. To let the universe take it�s course. Harry would be fine. Dudley would grow out of this idiocy. They were kids. Kids were assholes. I had no idea what my interference would bring.<br/> <br/> �He�s over there!�<br/> <br/> �Get that little freak!�<br/> <br/> I�m an idiot.<br/> <br/> I took a different hallway, jogging lightly. Soon I intercepted the path Harry had taken, and waited, chewing on my apple all the while, thinking carefully. <br/> <br/> Harry spun the corner. He saw me waiting. His eyes widened in fear. I rolled my eyes, waving at him. <br/> <br/> �Come on kid, they�re catching up.�<br/> <br/> My calm voice echoed. Some other students saw me call out to him and gave me looks like I was crazy. I ignored them to focus on the tiny glasses wearing future badass approaching me. He ran past me, never looking back. Man. Can�t blame him, but damn dude.<br/> <br/> A kid with a long nose and buck teeth came around the corner chasing after Harry. He didn�t notice me.<br/> <br/> Made hitting him in the face with an apple core easier.<br/> <br/> �Gah!� he stumbled, sputtering. I adjusted my backpack and waited.<br/> <br/> Another kid, then one more, came around the corner, followed by a whale in human clothing.<br/> �What did you do that for!?� the rat faced kid shouted at me. His friends pulled up behind him, looking at him, then at me in instinctual need to back up their homey.<br/> <br/> �Oh, my bad. I was throwing away trash, so I aimed at trash. As you do.�<br/> <br/> �...what?� the kid blinked.<br/> <br/> Damnit, kids have no appreciation for my jokes. <br/> <br/> �Don�t worry about it. So. Looks like you guys are chasing after someone. Kinda shitty, don�t you think?�<br/> <br/> �You�re defending that freak!?� Dudley stepped forward, using his mass to brush aside the others. �And why are you talking like that, are you a yank?�<br/> <br/> �Which question do you want me to answer first?�<br/> <br/> �What?�<br/> <br/> �Am I defending the kid, why am I talking like this, and am I a yank. Which question do you want me to answer first?�<br/> <br/> All four kids stared. The tall one in the back drooled a little.<br/> <br/> �Not the smartest bunc-�<br/> <br/> �Get him!�<br/> <br/> Incapable of understanding what was happening, they defaulted to their usual methods. The rat-faced kid rushed forward, his fists swinging. The other kids followed.<br/> <br/> My textbook filled backpack smashed into the rat kid�s stomach, followed by my palm striking into his nose. I internally winced at the feel of blood exploding under my palm as he screamed. Beating up little kids sucked. Even when you are one too, it sucked.<br/> <br/> When a tall kid approached, I grabbed his clumsy punching wrist and pulled him into an elbow strike in the chest. Pulling him in also brought him in front of a clumsy kick from his friend, sending him to the ground, where I kicked him in the stomach again.<br/> <br/> The kid who kicked his friend tried to kick again. I grabbed his foot and held it, forcing him to balance with wide panicked eyes. Dudley, approaching from behind, stopped for a sec, trying to move around his friend. I pulled the kid in and grabbed his face in one small hand while kicking his other leg from under him, smashing him into the ground and leaving me with Dudley.<br/> <br/> Who was going to be a problem. Dudley was bigger than me. Fat may not be as useful as muscle in a fight, but it�s still a defense for a kid. Hard to punch someone in the stomach when that stomach is covered in a layer of soft armor. <br/> <br/> Dudley faced me for a moment, his hands down but eyes hard. �You shouldn�t have done that, yank.�<br/> <br/> �You gonna talk, marshmallow boy, or fight,� I quipped calmly. �I�m honestly worried if I cut you bacon fat and butter will come out. Your belly button makes an echo. If you were a truck, you�d have a wide load sign. You-�<br/> <br/> �Ahhhhh!� with a cute child roar, the fat boy rushed me, leaving me unable to finish my Spider-Man routine. I thought, for a moment, about kicking him in the dick.<br/> <br/> It was the smart move. Just take him out fast. It was mean, but my other options were harder to implement. But�<br/> <br/> He was just a kid. Better for normal violence.<br/> <br/> I palm struck him in the face while dodging him, tripped him as he passed, then landed on his back. Dudley screamed when I grabbed his arm and twisted it behind him, forcing him to the ground. I watched Piers cry on the ground. The kid I�d kicked in the stomach was groaning next to the one I�d smashed into the floor. <br/> <br/> �Get off of me you- AHHH!� Dudley shouted again when I twisted a bit harder.<br/> <br/> A sigh left my lips. �Kid, you really gotta find a more constructive way to release these aggressive emotions. Play video games maybe, exercise that doughy fat ass.�<br/> <br/> <i>�WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?�</i><br/> <br/> I looked up. An adult woman was staring at us, horrified. Harry stood behind her, his eyes wide as he watched his tormentors cry. My shrug didn�t help the woman�s horror.<br/> <br/> �Involving myself in the main plot, apparently.�<br/> <br/> I wish I was smarter, because I could tell I was going to get in a lot of trouble from then on. <br/> <br/> <br/> <hr class="bbc-hr bbc-hr--3"><br/> <br/> <br/> �Never have we seen such violence in St. Grogory's,� Headmistress Roemmele said to my dad, her eyes wide. �Poor Mr. Polkiss has a broken nose, Dennis is still crying, and Dudley claims his arm was broken!�<br/> <br/> �Claims, not actually broken,� I pointed out. My dad sighed, rubbing at his mustache as Roemmele stared at me in horror. �And I told you. Piers attacked me.�<br/> <br/> �All four boys say you instigated it!� Roemmele shouted.<br/> <br/> �I didn�t. It�s my first day in this school. I was just trying to find my way around. They attacked me, I defended myself.�<br/> <br/> �You really expect me to believe-�<br/> <br/> �He does,� my dad stepped in, leaning forward. �Ms. Roemmele, I understand my son was more violent than you may be used to, but there were four boys fighting him. Are you saying that he found a group of four boys he didn�t know and attacked them for no reason?�<br/> <br/> She hesitated. My dad continued. �We can apologize to the parents if you wish, but it�s his word against theirs. Headmistress, you have to see how this looks.�<br/> <br/> The Headmistress was beginning to look a little harried. Her eyes snapped to me. I nodded slowly.<br/> <br/> �I�ll apologize, and I promise that I won�t ever fight in this school. Unless I get attacked. If someone tries to hit me and I can�t get to a teacher safely, I�m allowed to defend myself, right?�<br/> <br/> She looked even more harried at that, rubbing her face. �Is this just how children raised in America act?�<br/> <br/> �He�s never been to America,� my dad said, his face pained.<br/> <br/> She blinked at him, stared at me, then looked back at him. Then why-<br/> <br/> �I like American movies,� I lied. My dad rubbed at his mustache again.<br/> <br/> <br/> <hr class="bbc-hr bbc-hr--3"><br/> <br/> <br/> �Gar, I wish you had waited a day before getting in trouble again,� my dad said as we entered his car.<br/> <br/> �Believe me, I wish I�d avoided it, pops,� I sighed. �Those kids were trying to bully another one. Probably should have let them, but my dumb brain couldn�t just let that go.�<br/> <br/> He sighed. �Gar, when you say things like that you worry me.�<br/> <br/> �...Sorry.�<br/> <br/> �I�m used to it.�<br/> <br/> I winced. Yeah. At some point, I�m pretty sure my new mom and dad realized I didn�t love them as parents. Liked them. Listened to them. Hell, I actually did grow to love them. But I didn�t have anymore than a friendly kind of love for them. I considered them found family. Still love, but different enough that there was friction there.<br/> <br/> �I�ll apologize. Can�t promise it�ll be sincere, but I�ll say the words.�<br/> <br/> �That�s fine,� he said in the voice of the long suffering. <br/> <br/> Suck it up, pops, other people had it way harder. The uncharitable thought lasted for barely a second before I smothered it.<br/> <br/> Instead I focused on something else. Namely, what I had to prepare for.<br/> <br/> I didn�t have magic, so no Hogwarts for me. I did, however, live in a world of magic. That meant all its dangers existed. Dragons, dark wizards, werewolves, giant spiders, rugs that could eat you. Hell, if someone found out I knew about magic, the �good� wizards would mind rape memories of the wizarding world from my brain. What fucking fun.<br/> <br/> Gun. A gun would be good. Wizards are very powerful, but a bullet is a good equalizer for most things. Despite what some Potterheads would tell ya, �muggles� had some ways to even the odds with the various powers of magic. Voldemort would still need a whole army, but the average things you�d run into weren�t immune to small bits of metal at high speed.<br/> <br/> Maybe I could mix it with magic as well. Guns with bottomless magazines filled with bullets that could unleash a variety of effects on impact. Armor enhanced with spells. So on and so forth.<br/> <br/> My paranoia was going full on at the point we got to the house. I was thinking about the dozens of things that could end up killing me. Fantastic Beasts and how they can absolutely fuck you up. Harry Potter and Holy Shit That�s A Lot of Teeth.<br/> <br/> At home, once dad parked, I wasn�t really focused. My mind was still racing. I needed to go into my room, to write down a plan, to figure shit out.<br/> <br/> I slammed the door open and stepped out without looking.<br/> <br/> �Gar!� my dad shouted in horror.<br/> <br/> My eyes snapped up.<br/> <br/> The van was big. White. And moving very fast. I raised my hands up. My earlier paranoia and fear crystalized into a single moment as I realized what was coming.<br/> <br/> I fell onto my bed.<br/> <br/> �Guh!� My blankets wrapped around me, smothering me. I shouted when I landed on the floor, my heart thumping in my chest. �Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit!�<br/> <br/> My dad screamed outside. I finally untangled myself and ran to the window, pushing it up after fumbling with the lock. �Pops!�<br/> <br/> �Gareth!?� he looked around from the van he�d been crouched down near, his head scanning under it. When he saw me in the window, he looked like he was ready to collapse with relief. The van driver looked almost as relieved. �What happened!? How did you get up there?�<br/> <br/> �...I had to use the bathroom really badly. Can you get my bag?�<br/> <br/> While he tried to comprehend that, I felt my heart to continue to beat like a drum.<br/> <br/> Apparition. Magic. Accidental magic.<br/> <br/> This was both better and worse than my previous situation.<br/> <br/> <br/> <hr class="bbc-hr bbc-hr--3"><br/> <br/> <br/> Later that day, I had a guess as to what happened. Namely, since coming to this world, I hadn�t truly panicked or lost myself in my emotions. Kids were able to feel so much more strongly than adults. Anger, sadness, happiness, they all exploded within them.<br/> <br/> Dropping ice cream was the end of the world. Getting a new toy changed the world. Your crush not liking you back was the ultimate heartbreak. <br/> <br/> And magic responded to strong emotions. The stronger, the better. Accidental magic was just when enough of that emotion fed a kids power to allow them to make physics their bitch.<br/> <br/> Except, I never had that. I was a grown man, with a grown man�s perspective. I didn�t lose control of my emotions, not to the extent a kid did. I sucked it up when I had to do things I didn�t want, when the world didn�t bend to my whim. <br/> <br/> Until the day I was panicking from realizing what world I was in. Add in a van of coincidence, and boom. Magic.<br/> <br/> I had magic.<br/> <br/> What the hell did that mean? Did I always have it and not notice? I�d noticed I had a lot of energy, but how much of that was me noticing from being an adult in a kids body, and how much was me feeling magic inside me?<br/> <br/> Did magic in this universe even work that way? </hr></hr></hr></hr></div></div> </div>
