    <h2>Chapter 11 (No I'm Not Bankrupt)</h2>
    <p/>
    <div> <div> <div>Tokyo in winter looks magical. There's no other way to really put it. I've seen Chicago after the first snowfalls and it's amazing enough. But Tokyo looks like one big fruitcake. The kind you don't throw out. My family went wild when I sent them the first couple pictures I took.<p>I did consider taking a picture of the umbrella monster when it showed up again but I'm pretty sure I've been drummed out for doing that. Still, watching it hop around with a glob of snow on its head is weirdly funny. I found out that just because it looks dopey doesn't mean it's dumb. I've been testing its intelligence by seeing how it reacts to a laser pointer and it caught on the the fact I was controlling where the light moved pretty much instantly. It's still pretty benign though. Weird to look at but not something to be too worried about.</p><p>Still wondering how it would react to me trying to use it as an umbrella.</p><p>Anyway, we didn't get it easy just because it was snowing. Winterizing all the gear was a process that took days. I could swear we spent two days putting antifreeze on everything in the motor pool. We had another team making sure nothing in the armory froze up. There were inspections of every bit of inventory once a day. Captain Webber, a thirty year old officer from Alaska and one of the 'long timers' here was overseeing a lot of the winterizing work. He wasn't the worst officer I worked for but god, would it kill the guy to have a sense of humor that wasn't so dry?</p><p>I was doing my rounds around six in the evening when a call came in over the radio. It was Branson.</p><p>"Guys, we've got something in the training field," he said. Looks like a person's just… sitting there."</p><p>OK. We didn't have any training scheduled for that day or that time.</p><p>"Like what, is it a homeless person?"</p><p>"Not sure. It looks hunched over. Oh shit."</p><p>"What? Why 'oh shit'?"</p><p>"I… I think we might have a hypothermia case out there."</p><p>I winced.</p><p>"I'll be right out."</p><p>"Roger. I'll send word we might need a medical team."</p><p>I ran over to the training field and met up with a few other soldiers who were on guard duty when the call came out. Sure enough, we found a figure sitting in the middle of the training field. Some of us had sidearms but I doubted we'd need guns for this emergency. As I got close enough, I could see that this was a woman. A young one. And she wasn't slouched over she was… kneeling. Like both her knees on the ground.</p><p>I'm not sure how to describe how I felt when I got close enough to see her face but the best one I can think of is 'starstruck.'</p><p>The woman had black hair in a tight bun, glistening green eyes and skin like polished ivory. She was dressed in a light blue and white kimono. Her skin was completely flawless, no scars, no pimples, nothing. Smooth like marble. She had what would've been considered a generously sized chest back in the US, D cup if I had to guess.</p><p>I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen. Seriously, reps for cosmetics companies would be falling all over each other to have her as a spokesperson.</p><p>She seemed mildly interested in out presence but not that alarmed. Ramsay asked something to her in Japanese but she didn't respond. That wasn't a good sign. Part of what we covered in basic about hypothermia was the symptoms of each stage and if she was out here long enough she'd have lost the ability to talk coherently.</p><p>We needed to get her help. Fast.</p><p>"She's got something," said Ramsey. I looked down and he was right. She had holding what looked like a bundle to her chest. Then I noticed something else. The pin she was using to make sure her hair stayed in the bun was a transparent blue color. Like… an icicle. She was barefoot too.</p><p>This was starting to get really weird really quick. It's not that something wasn't adding up. In fact, I had an idea of what these clues were adding up to and I didn't like it.</p><p>"What've we got here?" asked Captain Webber. "What're you all standing around gawking a-"</p><p>He went completely white when he saw the woman. Her eyes widened when she saw him.</p><p>"Austin?" she asked. His voice seemed to die in his throat. How did she recognize him?</p><p>The thing in her lap turned to face him. It was a kid. Just old enough to be a toddler. A girl if I had to guess. She had a robe just like the bigger one.</p><p>"Tou-san?"</p><p>My jaw dropped. I knew what that word meant. It answered one question but the implications of what I heard were crowding out everything else in my head.</p><p>"Sir… what did you do?" asked Vargas. Webber's mouth was moving but nothing understandable was coming out. He took one step back. Then another.</p><p>He was trying to run. And knowing what prompted him to do that made me feel angry. Really angry. And it looked like I wasn't the only grunt there who felt that way. Branson, one of the other guards who came over, grabbed Webber by the shoulder.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going, sir?" he asked.</p><p>"Get your fucking hands off me," Webber growled. "Or I'll have you arrested for assault."</p><p>"Oh, I'll let you go. If you promise to tell us what this," he pointed at the woman and child in the snow 'is all about."</p></div> <div> </div> </div><p/><div> Last edited: Saturday at 9:42 PM </div> </div>
