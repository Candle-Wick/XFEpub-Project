“Lord. Commander. Dante.”<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Inquisitor Ramnos.”<br/>
<br/>
Flames curled from the tip of the inferno pistol at the Inquisitor’s side, while opposite him stood the resplendent Dante, the <i>Death Mask of Sanguinius</i> betraying no expression to the one who had come to test the Chapter and all those who stood behind him. For unlike the Inquisitor who stood alone save for a single squad of admittedly heavily equipped stormtroopers, behind the Lord Commander of the Blood Angels stood an honor guard of incomparable power and presence. For no simple terminators of any single 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company were these, but in fact Chapter Masters all. All of the Successor Chapters of the Blood Angels, all who had come to heed the call of the Old Angel.<br/>
<br/>
“Have you completed your investigation then?” Dante asked, his voice impossibly calm for a man for whom the gaze of the Inquisition had fallen so heavily upon.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes. You allied with the xenos, the Necrons,” Ramnos replied indifferently. “The standard punishment for such a collusion would be complete and total extermination.”<br/>
<br/>
It is quiet, there on Baal Secundus, yet violence slinks into the air and holds itself at the ready. More than a dozen Chapter Masters have not turned, have not turned their heads, yet energy coils and gathers inside of them all. The same is said of the somewhat more mortal stormtroopers behind the Inquisitor, their own experiences across this grim galaxy having hardened them to even a point of challenging astartes without fear. As Lord Commander and Inquisitor look upon each other, both know of what shall occur within but moments, as both multi-century old men wonder just who will make the first move.<br/>
<br/>
“The necron commander known as Anrakyr the Traveller has already left the Cryptus System – which I will remind you,” the Inquisitor glances from beneath the shadows of his hat where the sigil of his organization glimmers, “Is nigh uninhabitable now. Zarathusa the Ineffable – as he has proclaimed himself, has claimed the burnt husks of the worlds that you claimed to be working to protect.”<br/>
<br/>
Again, Dante says nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the Inquisitor tilts his head, his digi-weapon equipped fingers giving the appearance of nonchalance as they tap against his graviton pistol.<br/>
<br/>
“Have you rendered judgement, then, Inquisitor?” Dante finally speaks, his voice as steady as it has been since he learned that the whole of the Blood Angels and their Successors were under intense investigation for the Cryptus campaign.<br/>
<br/>
“I did,” Ramnos nods before his lips twist in a sardonic grimace, “Before my judgement was countermanded by my superiors. They denied my order of Exterminatus. How…merciful of them,” the Inquistor’s lips twisted further into an outright frown.<br/>
<br/>
Within helmets, concealed as such so that even the Inquisitor with his two bionic eyes cannot see, several relieved breaths are exhaled.<br/>
<br/>
“Your conflict against the daemonic creatures led by the Bloodthirster of whom I shall not name was deemed significant enough to have required all available forces instead of pursuing and eliminating the necrons who have laid claim to the Cryptus system.”<br/>
<br/>
“I see.”<br/>
<br/>
The Inquisitor then, with extreme gravity, spat on the surface of Baal Secundus, his hands in the pockets of his long coat, ignoring the sudden intensity of the attention upon him by all space marines present.<br/>
<br/>
“Your chapter has colluded with the most vile and dangerous xenos to have emerged in the galaxy over millennia. That is a taint that will never go unscrutinized again. Worse, the <i>known</i> Renegade Chapter of the Knights of Blood were not only allowed in system, but allowed <i>out</i>. But, again. I cannot refuse my own orders. So congratulations,” the Inquisitor brought his hands together and clapped once.<br/>
<br/>
Then he turned, and left, once again steadfastly ignoring the now seething glares painted at his back.<br/>
<br/>
But then, not even the Blood Angels on their own ground could see fit to slay Lord Inquisitors who were known to have openly arrived and not in secrecy. Only after his ship had breached atmosphere did Dante turn, having remained motionless up until that point, and faced the rest of his brothers.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Commander…?”<br/>
<br/>
“We live another day, my brothers, though now with the Inquisition’s eye upon us in greater intensity than in centuries,” Dante noted as he stepped forward to join in ranks with them as they as one returned towards the Fortress Monastery.<br/>
<br/>
“What of the Cryptus System,” one voice rose above the others.<br/>
<br/>
Seth.<br/>
<br/>
Always Seth, poking and prodding.<br/>
<br/>
“We shall leave it to the necrons for now,” Dante replied, and continued forward even knowing that the others around him would cease for a moment before following. “The tyranids splinter fleets yet still advance towards us. They shall, once more, go through the Cryptus System, and we shall offer the mad necron who calls himself lord nothing. Instead, we shall see to our own defenses.”<br/>
<br/>
For Ka'Bandha’s fury had been great and terrible, and yet more foes came to assail the Blood Angels, and for all that the Inquisition felt comfortable enough to arrive and make threats, Dante knew that the fight for Baal was far from over.</div>
