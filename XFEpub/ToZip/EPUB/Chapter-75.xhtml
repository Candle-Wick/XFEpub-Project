    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: The Eve of Battle</h2>
The dwarven advisors are first to speak. "King's Gates," Kragg says firmly. "Many dawi will die retaking this hold; their names must be carved in the Hall of Oaths."

"The Citadel," Durin says. "We could dominate the entire caldera with the field of fire it would allow us."

"Kvinn-Wyr," says Ulthar. "We could turn the Sentinels into a slaughtering ground for every grobi and thaggoraki in the Karak."

"The Entrance, and the Vaults," says Skaroki. "We could lure every mercenary in Tilea with them. And Tilean mercenaries are good, dependable troops, by manling standards."

"Well, that doesn't at all narrow it down," Belegar grumbles. "Let's hear it from the rest of you, then."

"The King's Gates," you say, pointing at Karag Lhune. "The airport opens up entirely new tactical and logistic possibilities, especially with Karaz-a-Karak and their aircorps so close by."

"The Citadel," Codrin says. "With that elevation, we could reap a harvest of the enemy with impunity."

"The Citadel," Titus agrees. "Let them dash their lives away upon it."

"The King's Gates," says Grand Master Wulfhart. "For the Temple. Dwarven souls need the balm of faith, just as ours do."

"The Entrance," Grand Master Kriegersen says. "And the West Gate. Kettle in the enemy and throttle the life from them."

Belegar looks broodingly down at the map. "Ulthar, second preference?"

He considers for a moment. "If we could secure the entirety of Karag Lhune, we could shorten our supply lines by receiving them at Und-Uzgar rather than going through the East Gate. So the King's Gates."

"Near enough to a consensus," Belegar remarks. "Any objections?" Silence in response. "Very well. It so happens that I agree - we have force enough to challenge the grobi and thaggoraki for at least one of the two peaks, and Karag Lhune is the more strategically sound of the two." He refurls the map. "Drink deep and rest well this night, for there's no telling when next we'll see a semblance of peace. Tomorrow, we march on the East Gate."

---

The Expedition encamped is a city in miniature that is torn down and rebuilt each day, housing over a hundred thousand souls, man, dwarf and halfling. And of this enormous force, you are responsible for only five. You weave your way through the tents to your own slice of meagre comforts. For possibly the first time, all five of your journeymanlings are in the same place, waiting together to hear your news.

"Karag Lhune," you say to them. "We march on the East Gate tomorrow, and from there we punch straight through to the King's Gate."

They nod. "Enemies?" Esbern asks.

"Likely greenskins on the gate," you say. "Unlikely to be the Crooked Moons in sunlight - perhaps they'll have another tribe living overhead. Ulthar's men have picked off Red Fang and Broken Toof greenskins while patrolling, and while the Red Fang dominate Black Crag we're not sure where the Broken Toof are operating out of, so it could be them. Once we reach the King's Gate, expect either the night goblins themselves or the ratmen."

There's sober nods all around. "Orders?" Maximilian asks.

To your carefully listening underlings, you lay out the plan for the next day's battles.

Your Place:
[ ] Sticking close to Belegar, just in case.
[ ] Mounting your Shadowsteed and fighting with:
- [ ] The demigryph knights

- [ ] Fighting among dwarves
- [ ] Fighting among humans
[ ] Striking at enemy lines wherever they seem most vulnerable
[ ] Trying to flank the enemy to strike at spellcasters and siege weapons

Esbern and Seija:
They are inseperable; Esbern is a dangerous melee combatant and Seija is skilled at assisting friendly animals and sabotaging unfriendly ones.
[ ] With you
[ ] With the Demigryph Knights
[ ] With the Winter Wolves

Panoramia:
Her offensive spells make her a terrifying threat at range, as thorned plants burst from the ground and sprout within the enemy.
[ ] With you
[ ] With Titus' skirmishers
[ ] With Codrin's archers
[ ] With Ulthar's rangers

Maximilian:
His spells make him a supernaturally resilient and accurate archer.
[ ] With you
[ ] With Titus' skirmishers
[ ] With Codrin's archers
[ ] With Ulthar's rangers

Johann:
He can supernaturally guide the efforts of his allies, which has won him a place among the dwarf siege engineers; he can also magically sabotage enemy wepaons.
[ ] With you
[ ] With the Siege Engine crews


- This vote will be in plan format.
- For full spell lists, see the Dramatis Personae page.
- If you are considering writing in a strategy, try to keep it simple. Mathilde knows well that the chaos of battle and the fog of war make a mockery of complicated plans.
- Wolf is not quite grown enough to fight by your side, and will be left with the camp followers.
