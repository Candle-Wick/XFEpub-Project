    <h2>075.M42 Interlude: By Belligerence, Break Everything</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>075.M42 Interlude: By Belligerence, Break Everything</b><br/>​</div>It was the psykers and daemons who heard it first. An incessant thumping beat, ragged and loud enough to send astropaths to babbling and cavorting. To grant headaches powerful enough to split the skulls of battlefield-sanctioned psykers apart. A rumbling and tumbling chorus of roars that tore its way through the warp itself. But that was one thing, and barely a blip on the attentions of most when it came down to it. Daemons were appearing in greater and greater numbers. The twisted and corrupted Hive Fleet Diablo and its master Bel'akor still fought against the manifested Daemon Primarch Angron. The warp recoiled and thrummed in a million unique manners daily and could not possibly be catalogued by any but the truly mad. But then the most outlying eyes, monitoring stations of the Imperium and accursed scrying rituals of Chaos alike began to go silent, or simply fail. A hurricane of reports was buffeted by a new wind, bold and full of alien savagery beyond compare.<br/>
<br/>
But then they came, howling out of a warp stained dark green by their passage, and there could be denial no longer.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=============================================================<br/>​</div>On the world of Cardinal World of Sabena, the mighty temples and shrines to the God-Emperor which had barely begun reconstruction after the planet's near razing by Abaddon's forces found themselves under assault once more. The Order of the Bloody Rose, sworn to the planet's defense, turned upon the new defilers with every bit of fury they had used to prevent the planet's fall to Chaos. The flames of the Cardinal World only grew higher than ever, however, as a massive space hulk identified as the <i>Zoggitall</i> appeared above while roks rained down uncountable numbers of fresh troops. For every ork the sisters of battle slew, a dozen more appeared, guffawing and firing their crude weapons in numbers enough to overwhelm every defensive position they came across. When the Canoness Cecilia rallied the defenders with her gleaming power sword in hand, there was hope. Fifteen charges did the greenskins send, each larger and more dangerous than the last, and fifteen times did Canoness Cecilia cast them back.<br/>
<br/>
Until the smoke belching hunks of rusted metal the orks called transports came down, bulky frames heaving from the overextended exertions of their engines. Even as rivets came loose as the sheer speeds unleashed by the machines nearly rocked themselves apart, they delivered their cargo.<br/>
<br/>
The Arch-Dictator of Gathrog, Mirgzag, was a hulking example of his species. The entire top half of his head had become cybernetic. Four separate chugging engines burned on his shoulders and back, the metal a permanent red hot glow which forever filled the air with the scent of slightly charred orkish flesh. But it was more than enough for his purposes. When Canoness Cecilia charged him, and his personal Gorka Guardz, he fired every weapon he knew he had, and a few more besides. Plasma blasts, hundreds of solid slug rounds, flamer gouts nearly twenty feet long, lightning whips, and even a screaming grot attached to a rocket fired from a launcher on his gut. Yet the Canoness blew through the smoke, surrounded in the holy aura of her rosarius. All of the other orks had shied away from the bright display, others dumbfounded that some of the biggest orks they'd ever seen were dying. Thus, only Mirgzag and his 'best boyz' remained to withstand the sisters. She slew five of his Gorka Guardz in as many seconds, orks who had fought in decades of endless war, and the hearts of the Imperial defenders soared to watch her and her seraphim fly out on wings of flame.<br/>
<br/>
Their hearts were thus crushed all the more when Mirgzag reached out, his entire cybork arm crackling with strange mek-devised energies, and popped the bubble of protective light surrounding Canoness Cecilia in a single impossible instant. For too many years had Mirgzag nearly slain his greatest rival, the Great Despot of Dregruk, only for said ork warlord's energy fields to keep that final blow from landing the right way. And while this was not Gazgrim himself, the ire towards such protective fields remained. Canoness Cecilia had enough time to scream as the technologies of the rosarius device granted to her erupted in a shower of circuitry and flaming metal. She lived, her throat and lower jaw ruined by the amulet's destruction, just long enough for Mirgzag to kick her over onto her back and stomp her entire torso and head into paste under his enormous squig-leather boots.<br/>
<br/>
"Right you lot!" Mirgzag roared, waving for his boyz to continue the assault on the shrine. "Let's get dis done! I ain't losin' to Gazgrim, for Gork's sake!"<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==========================================================================<br/>​</div>The Hive World of Belisar had still not recovered from Lucius the Eternal's passage. The world itself seemed locked into continual screaming horror. Every implanted citizen, every member of the PDF, of those Guard Regiments temporarily stationed there before being plunged into the Cadian System or elsewhere, all of these reported the same thing. Screaming nightmares, dredged from the spirits of the slain to be replayed again and again. The wind itself seemed to carry the horror of the Chaos Champion's victims. To be there, was to know all of this would continue forever, the world itself scarred by the Eternal's passage. But orks did not fear such silly things as nightmares, nor such curses as the one levied by one of Slaanesh's most favored champions. When the <i>Orkpokolips</i> arrived over the planet, its archipelago of orkish battleships surrounding it, there was a new flavor to the planet's screams. One that only briefly enjoyed by the Prince of Excess before all sensation was drowned out by the energies of the WAAAGH!<br/>
<br/>
A thousand pict-captures displayed the enormous ork warlord known as Grizgutz, for no happier was the ork than when he was able to fire his favorite gun. That there was the stench of paradox on the second of his weapons – claimed from the killing of his own self after arriving backwards in time through the warp – did not concern him at all. All that mattered was that he shot apart everything in sight, whether it was guardsmen, sororitas, astartes, or otherwise. Up to and including his own men. There was a massive crater to his head now, however, one that was clearly far more recent due to the fact that it still wept blood occasionally when he turned too quickly, or his blood pumped too hard, or any other number of factors. All around him, his old WAAAGH!! possessed literally half again its old numbers, for when his orks had run into…his orks…they had settled matters as orks settled almost all disputes. Not that the Imperium would be able to care that there was the same nob in two places on the planet, or that a trio of battlewagons merrily crushing their way through a line of tanks was the literal exact same trio of battlewagons rolling over a regiment of guardsmen ten miles away.<br/>
<br/>
Such temporal issues didn't matter. All that mattered was the fight.<br/>
<br/>
"Zog me, wot was I finking," Warlord Grizgutz mused to himself as he picked an astartes arm out of his metal teeth, "Tryin' to get a third one of me favorite gun wiv dat warpy nonsense? When dere was so much foighting to be done!? Har har! Gork n' Mork set me straight!"<br/>
<br/>
Then he rallied up a number of nearby flash gits as he charged the heavy bolters of the Knights Unyielding space marines.<br/>
<br/>
"Ya hear dat, you spacey marines!? DA PROPHET OF GORK N' MORK SET ME STRAIGHT TO YA! DIS WAAAGH! AIN'T LOST!!! NO MORE!!!!"<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=============================================<br/>​</div>Demios Binary was a valuable prize for the Imperium as well as Abbadon's forces. A Forge World directly adjacent to the Cadian System, able to produce vast amounts of war material. Only recently had they unveiled lost technologies, laser battery arrays deep within the planet's crust. Such anti-orbital weaponry, capable of striking down the invading fleets of Chaos more than once, were of obvious value to the Imperium. Senior Magos from Mars itself had been sent to examine these things thought lost. Yet before such studies could be completed, the orks arrived as they had elsewhere. On a storm of metal and fury fueled by alien savagery that cared little for the conflicts that had come before. As the ancient weapons batteries of Demios Binary began to fire again, and again, and again, there was contentment in the servants of the Omnissiah and those of the God-Emperor alike in their ships above. Pure destruction was unleashed upon kroozer after kroozer, after rok shower after rok shower. Here, then, was safety in superior firepower.<br/>
<br/>
But the orks refused to stop coming.<br/>
<br/>
Another ten waves, and ancient coils began to send worried signals in arcane manners that the techpriests of the Forge World has lost the knowledge to recognize, much less respond to. Another series of waves, and building-sized barrels began to bend out of shape, repeated fire without maintenance taking its toll. More ships arrived in orbit, showers of white-hot shrapnel and wreckage becoming an unending deluge which began crashing onto the planet below. Planetary shielding began to struggle to withstand the load not of weapons fire, but of the debris left behind being trapped into the planet's own gravity well.<br/>
<br/>
Until one of the old, old guns simply ceased to fire. Down below the surface, its venerable reactor had been pushed beyond the breaking point after too long a period of inactivity. It shattered, plasma and lethal radiation venting outwards in all directions. This, then, affected the rest of the grid, straining every other weapon in that continental plate's array. One after another, they began to break apart. In one horrible instance, the gun snapped at the base and collapsed to the ground and crushed thousands beneath itself. Until the chain reaction of this crust-sunken array of ancient weapons began to affect far more than themselves. Certain shielding reactors began to break apart, factorums belching fires into their own innards and turning servitors, servants, and techpriests alike to cinders.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did the space hulk arrive, a leering face of Gork (or Mork) gazing down at the planet below. Ten asteroid belts' worth of metals had been required for the cunning ruse of 'throw scrap at 'em till da dakka stops'. Hundreds of thousands of orks had been sacrificed by their boss to ensure that said scrap had been worth shooting at. Had any of the ships made it into threatening range, they would even have had guns to shoot with. But none were as dangerous as Da Great Killa. Or the bevy of larger ork 'battleships' which arrived as well, accompanied by entire shoals of kill kroozers. Or the shower of roks that came soon after, each carrying far more orks than the ones that had been launched beforehand. The full resources of a true orkish empire was unleashed, and for all that the planet had weathered the vagaries of Chaos since the Horus Heresy, it was not prepared for the greenskins. How could it be, when so many resources had been drained towards the Cadian system and other nearby embattled sectors?<br/>
<br/>
Gazgrim, the Great Despot of Dregruk, cared little about all of this.<br/>
<br/>
"I ain't losin' dis race, you 'ere me, you sparky gits!" He roared from atop a pile of skitarii corpses. "I ain't! I'ze gonna get dere first, and I'll be da Boss's biggest Underboss!"<br/>
<br/>
A tank shot from a Leman Russ sent him skidding backwards, his power klaw digging into the earth to arrest his momentum. Upon sighting the dent in his armor, he roared in fury and began charging forward again.<br/>
<br/>
"You ain't Mirgzag! You ain't even da prophet! Don't make me laff wiv weak hits like dat!"<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=================================================================<br/>​</div>Forge World Kantrael, as with literally every other world of strategic import and many besides across the Cadian Sector, had been hard fought for decades upon decades now. Strategic stockpiles had been exhausted a generation ago, all the while the 13th Black Crusade had continued. Against Eldar Corsairs, Dark Eldar slavers, traitorous pirates, and most of all the forces of Chaos under the nominal control of the Despoiler. So, too, had the occasional group of greenskins drifted in, as was their wont, chasing the promise of battle and death. But never had they faced a tide such as the one they faced now. Ships had flooded out of what could be considered the galactic northeast. Cogitator banks had worked frantically to identify the incoming attackers, and what they found was chilling indeed. Symbols, old signatures, these were of aid, but the orks that came for the Forge World and the rest of the Cadian Sector had no interest in concealing their names or their origin.<br/>
<br/>
"DIS PLACE, AND ALL DE UDDERS, ARE GONNA BE MINE!" Came the bellowed roar, across ever available vox channel. "YOU READY, UMIES!? DA GREAT PROPHET SAID DIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST FIGHT OF YER MISERABLE LIVES!"<br/>
<br/>
Astropathic messages carried information across the whole of the galaxy. But they could be delayed. They could be changed. They could be halted. The vagaries of the Warp ensured such things came to pass with distressing regularity, especially this at the foot of the Eye of Terror itself. As such, it had not been quite understood, at first, when the reports had been sent from the Calixis Sector towards Segmentum Command. Or perhaps, disbelieved. It would not be the first time, and many of the Administratum Adepts had flatly refused to consider that such fanciful things could come to pass. After all, when was the last time that a solidifying ork empire would simply uproot itself in its totality and move on? Orks, once they had taken a place, could only be torn out by violent force. Either from rival greenskins, or other forces most preferably being the Imperium.<br/>
<br/>
"LET'S SEE IF YOU'ZE BETTER DEN THEM OTHER HUMIES, I GOT TOLD YOU CADIANS ARE DEAD 'ARD!"<br/>
<br/>
Said adepts would have years to blubber out excuses to their superiors when the reports came from the Cadian Sector that the Warlord Ghenghiz Grimtoof, the Git-Slaver, who had grown into a worse and worse threat for almost a century in the Spinward Front, had taken all of his boyz and shoved them onto a great fleet and taken them towards Cadia. A fleet which now laid siege to worlds across the galactic western systems of the Cadian Sector, landing hundreds of thousands of greenskins in the first week. The Calixis Sector had breathed a sigh of relief, for they had been able to turn their attentions more wholly onto the frustratingly long-standing rebellious Dominate and had crushed it. The Cadian Sector's suffering was the Calixis Sector's gain.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">====================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>​</div>The Cardinal World of Xersia had suffered greatly. But then, so had every world in the Cadian Gate by now. The 13th Black Crusade, or as some of the most despairing whispered the Endless Black Crusade, had been battering the Imperium for close to a century now. Xersia had suffered from Dark Eldar early on, but more recently had faced all a manner of assaults by the forces of the Despoiler. Most terrible, in the past handful of years, had been an attempt by the Death Guard to render the world utterly into the grasp of Nurgle. But for the sacrifice of the Blood Ravens Dreadnought-Librarian Konan Barbariel in banishing the Great Unclean One Pestilax the Despairer, the Death Guard might have succeeded. And though the increasingly famous Penitent Raven Aramus had led his mixed assortment well alongside the Sororitas and Guard units deployed, there had nevertheless been terrible damage done to the planet.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, for a brief moment, the utterly insane had thought that Xersia might have more than a year or two to rebuild. The majority of the Adeptas Sororitas who had sworn to defend the Cadian Gate to their dying breaths, to the Guard still there, to the Ecclesiarchy who had stared into the Eye of Terror their entire lives? They had known the grim truth and had set about not simply rebuilding the shrines and temples, but in building out new heavy defenses as well. With all the fervor and resources of the Ecclesiarchy as their disposal, a remarkable amount had been done, but all knew that it would be tested sooner rather than later.<br/>
<br/>
Such pessimistic projections were proven true as the skies tore open above Xersia, letting loose a torrent of ork ships belching weapons fire and landing craft. At their head was a space hulk which looked like an already huge ork kroozer had simply been stuck on top of it. Those from the Koronus Expanse might have identified it as the Fist of Gork, or Da Wurldbreaka. In truth, it was both, the former derelict hulk restored to functionality by none other than the infamous Orkimedes at the orders of the Great Prophet, and subsequently melded with the latter. Even if that melding had largely been welding more than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
"Woah! Now <i>dat</i> is a shiny planet, look at it all gleaming-like!" the Warlord of Undred-Undred Teef roared across the vox to all the ships in his fleet. "I wants it! Da Prophet said we could take whatever we wanted, and I want it! So go gets it, boyz! Morgaash Kulgraz gets wot 'e wants!"<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
<br/>
====================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>​</div>The Agripinaa Sector was weary. Systems across Segmentum Obscurus and around the Eye of Terror were weary. But such was the state of the whole of the Imperium, the weary and seemingly infinite giant that bled from a billion wounds. There were many conflicts raging that could shatter the average mind to try and comprehend, from the nightmarish ongoings of Octarius, the Tyrannic Wars that had engulfed whole sections of the galaxy including the Realm of Ultramar, the still-burning 3rd War for Armageddon, and more. But the 13th Black Crusade was especially severe, even by pan-galactic standards. Agripinaa, as a Sector, had been almost entirely lost to the forces of Chaos, the barbarity of the greenskin, the viciousness of the Dark Eldar, and more. For a time, only the capital system of Agripinaa had remained unconquered, a burning light amidst a flood of darkness. Until the Imperium had returned, and in a wave of faith and fury had swept all before them and set about reclamation and rebuilding efforts. A trying task at the best of times, even more so as the forces of Chaos continued to burst forth form the Eye regularly, raiders and killers spinning away from the Cadian Sector to attack the utterly strained Imperial lines.<br/>
<br/>
But this could not have prepared it, not truly, for the roaring and grunting which began to be pumped through the Warp itself. Astropaths bled from the ears, deafened in soul and body, as the noise continued to increase. It was accompanied by crude but impossibly loud music forcibly shoved through the vox waves, the sound of thousands of strands of metal being strummed by thick brutish fingers. The chugging and churning of a half million engines, the most beautiful of sounds for some. It was a heralding, an announcement, a byproduct of what drove along the stellar roads towards the galactic north. Whatever the original destination had been, it no longer mattered. Not when the Prophet had come, and definitely not after he'd thumped a great many heads. Krumped some outright, in fact. Throughout Segmentum Pacificus and Segmentum Solar, far too many adepts and Generals and Admirals had breathed a sigh of relief as the green sea had turned away.<br/>
<br/>
They would not have, had they known the new destination.<br/>
<br/>
From the galactic south, they arrived. Dozens upon dozens of ramshackle ships, belching fire and smoke. Roks came slamming down across world after world, spewing out hordes of bikes and wagons loaded to the point of sagging with guns and engines both. War trukks and battlewagons came thundering out across new plains and new battlefields, firing at shocked and dismayed Imperial defenders and colonists both. And, as was the way of greenskins, often firing right at one another as well. It was an ocean of green and red, for every spare piece of metal that could be found had been painted crimson from every source possible including blood. But of course, that was only right for the greatest assembly of the Kult of Speed in the entire galaxy. A hundred ork boys were slaughtered beneath the grinding wheels of a massive warbike which came screaming down out of one of the lead roks. Several flaming skulls burned brightly from the back of the pike where they remained on their pikes.<br/>
<br/>
"C'MON! C'MONC'MONC'MONC'MON!" Wazdakka Gutsmek crowed as the Bike of the Aporkalypse zoomed forward out onto his latest battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The Speedlord had come, and if he'd gotten a bit lost on the way to Cadia, that was fine.<br/>
<br/>
It was, after all, all about the journey…and how fast and violent that journey could be.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">========================================================================<br/>​</div>A fresh wave of Chaos vessels burst from the Eye of Terror, streamers of bled immaterium dripping off of them as the daemons infused into the hulls howled in pain. To oppose them, a weary flotilla of Battlefleet Solar rose up to battle them in turn. As they began to trade fire at the greatest possible ranges by lancer battery and macro weapon, others began to join the fight. Cruisers that had served for a thousand years in the Eye of Terror met with those who had served the Emperor for just as long. Battleships new and old, pure and tainted, began to crack each other's void shields and burn through plating alike. Over a thousand individual pilots soared into the void between ships, trading fire and unleashing bombing runs as the fighting raged all around them. Escorts in their dozens concentrated all their firepower to open a single hole in enemy formations through which another ship might break through. The Glorianas, claimed and corrupted vessels under the stewardship of the Daemon Primarch Perturabo, were assaulted by so many crude guns that the seething master of the Iron Warriors had to pull them back for emergency repairs, sending precisely calculated waves of lesser ships forward to screen them as they fell back bleeding unnatural fluids and shrapnel.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it was all for naught as the supermassive space hulk <i>Da Big Wurd</i> came bellowing out of the warp, crashing through a corrupted Emperor-class battleship in the process, snapping the ancient Chaos-helmed vessel into fiery and atmosphere venting pieces. It was followed by a fleet that was too large for damaged auspexes to count, too numerous to believe at first. The largest space hulk of all the recent sightings near the Eye of Terror did not stop with its more conventional engines, firing in every direction as it went. Behind it, dragged along by the violence it left in its wake, came the fleet of ork ships. Three Imperial battlegroups were smashed apart attempting to stymie the tide before they realized the futility of directly attempting to block it. Instead they turned to firing upon the flanks of the orkish swarm, exhausting nova cannon ammo stores and torpedo stocks alike. On the other side, the forces of Chaos did the same, traitors and madmen furious at having their chosen foes torn away from them by the xenos.<br/>
<br/>
The greenskins did not care, plunging as one unstoppable mass towards the planet Cadia and its orbital theatre.<br/>
<br/>
When <i>Da Big Wurd</i> landed, it did so with a continent-shaking impact that threw up dust and ash into the atmosphere above. It did so above an Imperial landing zone that had been retaken but a few months before through the sacrifice of a dozen regiments and detachments of five different space marine chapters. The Warmonger-class titan <i>Perfuga Delenda Est</i> was destroyed instantly, the god-machine crushed and melted in a single blow alongside all of its attendants. Those new regiments which had been rallying there were alternatively burnt into nothingness by the impact or crushed by the debris. Or both. Any possible survivors did not do so for long, as more and more roks began to land as well, while the vast ocean of ork ships immediately spread out over the planet's atmosphere, fighting with every Imperial and Chaos vessel brave enough to try and face them.<br/>
<br/>
Soon enough a bulkhead door found itself thrown open, quite literally. The heavy metal slabs bounced twice from the immense strength behind their expulsion from their hinges. With one steel-shod stomp after another did the Beast of Armageddon step foot onto Cadia's surface. He grunted at the sight of the stars above, almost completely obscured by battle. Fleets slammed against one another in numbers and enough weaponry to make the stars seem dim in comparison. A few more steps, and he glared out to see the incoming reprisals, though the visions were more in his brutish mind than anything he could possibly see with just his immediate sight. But oh, in his mind's eye…<br/>
<br/>
Enraged and desperate space marines, their armors all a manner of colors. Some shouting to their Emperor, others to their Chaos Gods. Spiked or not spiked, they'd both come. What humans called guardsmen which were their own special kind of fight if pushed hard enough. Those howling humans with pyromania. Daemons. New sorts of things, as well, shaped sort of like humans, but not quite, different on the inside and some on the outside. All in numbers he could only have dreamed of at Armageddon. The fact that it had taken him this long to get here made him spit. Sure, he'd had to thump a lost WAAAGH!! and a few more ork empire's into fighting something <i>other </i>than each other, but it would be worth it. He knew it would. After all, he'd made sure to land right where both kinds of humans would have to come after him.<br/>
<br/>
Ghazghull Mag Uruk Thraka grunted and slowly gestured to the smoke and blood covered horizon with his fire and lightning-wreathed power klaw.<br/>
<br/>
<b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:rgb(0, 179, 0)">"Look at all that fighting. And they kept it from us. The biggest fight in the galaxy...and without any orks</span></b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:rgb(0, 179, 0)">!"</span><br/>
<br/>
Then he turned and pointed with his shoota towards an infernal bastion of Chaos built as much out of stone and metal as it was out of blood, bile, and bone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:rgb(0, 179, 0)">"</span><b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:rgb(0, 179, 0)">Well...no more of <i>that</i>. Because now the orks <i>are</i> here!"</span></b><br/>
<br/>
He did not bother looking back as he raised his weapons high, rearing his head back and letting loose the ubiquitous call.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 1.625rem"><span class="fixed-color" style="color:rgb(0, 179, 0)">"<b>WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGHHHH</b>!!"</span></span><br/>
<br/>
More than a half a million orks who had come in the initial landing echoed the scream with him. Some were veterans of Armageddon. Others of Octarius. Still more of Deliverance. A great many of the latest had been those once part of WAAAGH!! Ozdakka which had been milling about for years after its momentum had been broken. The greenskins charged Imperial lines. They charged the Despoiler's lines. In many cases, they charged at each other before a nob or boss came along to thump them in the right direction. Behind the Beast of Armageddon, lesser warlords raced to join him at Cadia, leaving burning ruin in their wake. Soon enough, from the bellies of the purposefully crash-landed ships came gargants and mega-gargants, bikes and battlewagons, squigs and squiggoths. Orks fought with Chaos Space Marines, with daemons, with cultists, with New Men, and more. They exchanged fire with Guardsmen and Sororitas and loyalist Astartes, Ecclesiarchal volunteers, and more. The Great WAAAAGH!!! that had struck and nearly brought Segmentum Tempestus to its knees was not finished, though its momentum had been broken in the galactic south. There, the greenskins fought the Imperium and a dozen more newly revealed xeno races as well as the awakening necrons of the Maynarkh and Agdagath Dynasties. But the Great WAAAGH!!! of Segmentum Obscurus had just begun.</div>
