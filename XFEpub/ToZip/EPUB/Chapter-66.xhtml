    <h2>Interlude - Scouting the Near-Badlands, Part 1</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[*] You don't know enough to make a decision one way or the other. Follow the creature and see if its actions shed light on its purpose.



As you watch the beast effortlessly lope across the landscape, you're torn by indecision. From a certain perspective, the appearance of a Dragon Ogre isn't really important. The Expedition already knew that the World's Edge Mountains were full of dangerous enemies, the exact variety of those enemies doesn't change anything. But while you're far from the only one capable of scouting, you may be the only one capable of remaining unseen while keeping up with the beast, and any information you uncover about the creature could be important.

Part of you also wonders whether you could beat it in a fight, but you're pretty sure the clincher would be the combined Rune of Spite and the Seed of Regrowth, and you're less than enthusiastic about weaponizing your own painful death.

Magic is a wonderful tool, but without the right spells it has its limits. There's a spell to make the caster outright invisible, but even if you knew it the duration on it is severely limited. The spells you know to make you harder to spot are of limited use, because you're a rider in the middle of an empty field and there's no amount of 'harder to spot' that would leave you anything less than plainly obvious. But you can make yourself harder to notice. The beast is likely on the lookout for wild game or greenskins, and as he's not looking for a human rider specifically, Take No Heed would make you hard to notice. He'll see you, but as long as you don't draw attention to yourself his eyes will glaze right past you as it does countless rocks and shrubs.

In theory, anyway. Psychological spells are tricky when nonhumans are involved, and it's possible he would still consider a human to be 'wild game'. You'll still do your best to keep terrain between you and him.

[Stealth vs spotting: 91+17+10=118 vs 31]

You trail it from a distance as it moves with frightening ease over the broken terrain, stopping at each rise to scan the horizon. It's predictable enough that you're always out of sight and never have to put your magic to the test. Then his speed redoubles after he scans the horizon after what seems like several hours of trailing him, and you look ahead to spot what he has spotted: a small band of orc archers, large even for their oversized kind and carrying enormous bows.

The orcs spot the charge of the Dragon Ogre in plenty of time to open fire on the massive target, and at this distance you can't see if any of the arrows struck home but it obviously wasn't enough to deter the beast. He smashes into the orcs with a thunderous crash that carries to you and lays about him with his axe, felling a pair of orcs in a moment. The rest of the orcs try to retreat but are chased down and felled one by one. The entire combat from charge to extermination took just a handful of heartbeats.

You watch as the Dragon Ogre gathers up the fallen orcs, slinging some over its shoulders and others over its reptilian rear half, and then when laden with its gruesome cargo it sets its sights on Thunder Mountain in the distance and sets off, now moving much slower. It will be much easier to tail now, but if it is heading for Thunder Mountain, at its current speed it won't reach it until after dusk.

You're also bothered by a thought: if the beast is heading to Thunder Mountain instead of merely using it as a landmark to navigate by, then either the volcano is no longer under control of the Night Goblins, they've made some accord with the beasts, or Night Goblins and Dragon Ogres are locked in war with each other. Either way, this would be important information for the Expedition.

[ ] Continue following it. It would be good to know where this creature calls home, and whether there are more of it.
[ ] It's moving away from the path the Expedition will take, that makes it no longer your problem. Get back on course and head for the port.
