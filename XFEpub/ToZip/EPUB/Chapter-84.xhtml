[X] Plan Murderbeast Distraction
-[X] Sabotage the defences...
-- [X] By unleashing whatever is under this floor upon the greenskins above it.
-[X] Slip out...
-- [X] By walking out while they're otherwise distracted. (note: ensure your plan includes an otherwise distraction)



Looking at the enormous section of wooden flooring, you can almost see the thought process of whichever greenskin designed it. A Skaven assassin, or a skulker from a rival tribe, or anyone else that might be sneaking around here would see the bolt throwers ready to fire and the goblins gathered obligingly before them, and they would scamper towards them with all speed and be assaulted from below. Possibly a secondary purpose too: if attacked from the outside by a force they could not handle, the Goblins would flee out side passages or along the stone sections nearest the wall, and the pursuers would gleefully charge forwards and run over the covered pit. And if the Goblins forgot and ran over the pit, who cares? These were normal Goblins, who were very clearly lower in the local pecking order than Night Goblins.

You could see some megalomaniacal Night Goblin Boss ordering the excavation of the pit and the construction of the covering, chortling with glee and imagining the shock and horror on the face of whoever it caught as an enormous clawed hand smashed through the floor and pulled them down. Should any of their underlings have the common sense to be able to spot the flaws, they either kept it to themselves out of spite or were punished for daring to question their superior. Or perhaps they merely never cared about possible consequences. If a particularly stupid or drunk Goblin walks over the trap, the others would likely consider that hilarious, rather than a tragic accident.

Whatever their exact thoughts, you feel absolutely sure their plans never accounted for you.

You take a few steps further back from the bonfires and towards where the shadows were deepest, and let Shadowcloak disperse before reforming Ulgu into a much trickier spell. Substance of Shadow was not just difficult in the sense of the complexity of the spell, but in the strange and counter-intuitive rules it followed. The incorporeality it granted was conditional and confusing, and the consequences of the spell being broken while the caster was halfway through something were as unpredictable as they were gruesome. But for now you didn't need that - just the invisibility.

[Teasing the beast: Intrigue, Breakpoints 40/80, 92+17=109.]

The wood groans a protest as your Move spell shoves it downward, and a moment later the wood explodes upwards in a shower of splinters as whatever is underneath punches at the motion. Shouts of alarm ring from the mass of Goblins as a second magical shove triggers a second violent reaction, and you use Sound to simulate the scampering footfalls of something just barely evading the grasp of the beast. A third impact, and a voice is rising over the babbling from the Goblins as one of them takes charge, and shouting fills the adjoining tunnels as messages are passed along. By the time Goblins rush back into the hall with armfuls of pikes and long torches, the floor is half in ruins and roars of frustrations are echoing from at least a dozen throats as your teasing drives them into a frenzy.

[Growing infuriation: Intrigue vs Diplomacy, 86+17+20(previous crit)=123 vs 91+5=96]

The braver or more ambitious Goblins line the stone and you shrink back against the wall as a flaming torch draws near to you, but the danger passes as it is jabbed down into the hole beneath. The torch illuminates the extremely upset face of a Stone Troll, which roars in annoyance as the flame jabs it in the face, an action repeated all over the room as Goblins attempt to dissuade the Trolls from their rampage. The Troll nearest you grabs at the torch scorching his face and the Goblin lets go just in time to have kept its balance, but your foot applied at speed to its rear sends it toppling into the pit. Seconds later the crunch of bone adds a new note to the chorus of shouting, and that one of them is momentarily distracted by its meal only serves to drive the others into greater action. This seems to inspire the greenskins, and a dozen different fights break out as 'volunteers' are sought to sate the hunger of the Trolls. The first of these is thrown in by two others, and is grabbed in a stony fist before it hits the ground. The other Trolls settle down, staring avidly upwards and waiting for their own meal. You momentarily wonder how many such meals would have taken place to have penetrated through the stupidity of the Trolls, and then you put those thoughts aside as you decide how best to shatter this newfound peace. A few seconds later, your Magic Dart nails a Troll directly in the nose. It howls in outrage, and responds by punching the Troll next to it in the stomach.

The two brawling Trolls cause the Goblins to once more pick up their sticks to try to separate them, which only infuriates the others who were waiting for meals, and their grasping hands are met by the crude clubs and knives of Goblins at risk of being eaten. This is the last straw, and the terrible and unmistakable sound of a puking Troll fills the air, and a geyser of stomach acid shoots upwards and several Goblins caught in the stream scream in agony. Two massive hands grip the edge of the pit, and the first of the Trolls begins to haul itself up and out with the Goblins nearest it too distracted by their melting flesh to interrupt. Yells turn to screams as whichever of the Goblins that was nominally in charge of the situation loses control of it completely, and more begin to haul themselves out. Their empty spaces are filled by smaller Trolls, ones who evidently lost the argument below to be nearest the action, and Goblins begin to scatter as the Troll riot turns into a full-fledged exodus.

[Recasting: Learning, Req 40, 20+20=40.]
[Goblin spot check: 66+10-30(very distracted)=26]
[Shove your way through the crowd: Martial 25+19=44 vs 77+10=87]
[First strike: Martial, 46+19=65 vs 94+10=104]
[Follow up: Martial, 79+19-10(sucker punched) vs 41+10-20(hit twice as hard)]

It's into this chaos that you begin to run, trying and failing to cast Doppelganger before you get close enough to the bonfires to break Substance of Shadow, but it seems none of the greenskins decide the glimpse they catch of you before the spell takes hold is more important than the rampaging Trolls. But though there is no organized resistance against you, the confused snarl of panicking Goblins provides plenty of disorganized resistance, and one in particular objects enough to your shove to return it with one of his own, greenskin animosity compelling him to instantly respond by punching the offending party in the face. Beneath the illusion this corresponds to your stomach, and the sucker punch drives the wind from you. Under his fist, a Dwarvish rune retaliates and the goblin doubles up in agony, and as soon as you've recovered enough to move your fist connects with his face. The Goblin evidently lacks both illusion and runic reprisals, and he disappears into the press of Goblins and is immediately trampled underfoot.

[Continue through the crowd: Martial: 18+19=37 vs 16+10=26]

With the first fistfight you've had in thirteen years over, you wade through the crowd once more and make your way to the wooden gate. Several Goblins have had the same idea, and you wait impatiently as the three ahead of you each squeeze through the point where the shoddily-made doors meet. As you squeeze through, you're forced to shove aside the one that was ahead of you, who froze stock-still directly ahead of you. The reason is very quickly obvious, as you look down a row of way too many Dwarven crossbows pointed directly at your sternum. Lying sprawled on the stone in front of you are the previous Goblin escapees, riddled with bolts.

[Think fast: Martial, 67+19+10(Brave)=96.]

Your illusory self is unarmed, so lifting your hands seems to an observer like an act of surrender. This buys you half a second. Your actual self is far from it, and you draw your greatsword and swing it through the neck of the Goblin next to you. This buys you two seconds as the Rangers attempt to make sense of one Goblin apparently decapitating another with an invisible sword. Ulgu disperses at your extremely hurried urging, and your true form reasserts itself, and though the crossbows don't lower, fingers ease slightly away from triggers. "I was warned something like this might happen," one says, who you recognize as Ulthar. "Lass, which of us killed more greenskins in the courtyard at Und-Uzgar?"

You relax slightly. "They were already dead when we got there. I killed all the Skaven in the courtyard of Und-Uzgar, all the rest were killed inside."

"Right you are." He barks something in Khazalid, and the Rangers shift their crossbows slightly so they're still pointed at the gates, but not at you specifically. You gladly take the opportunity to shift out of the line of fire, and behind you there's a series of soft, fleshy thunks as another Goblin squeezes through the Gates and near-instantly meets his fate. "Vanguard's about half an hour from us," Ulthar reports. "We came ahead to finish off the catapults, just in case they got lucky." Sure enough, the secondary peak is still, with the crews and would-be ammunition of the Doom Diver catapults scattered about and sporting newly-acquired crossbow bolts, and trudging up the stairs towards you is the Karag Lhune invasion force, headed by the Vanguard.

You take a moment to gather your thoughts and fully recover from the sucker-punch, and will shortly make your way down to meet the Vanguard, make your report to Belegar, and decide what further part you'll play in this day's events.
