    <h2>Character Creation - Part 3</h2>
Seems like a consensus to me. A peasant girl of Stirland turned Grey Wizard. Let's move on to the most intricate and finicky part of character creation.


Faith, choose one:

[ ] Sigmar: God of Mankind, father of the Empire.

[ ] Ulric: God of Winter and Wolves, younger brother of Taal. Ulrican and Sigmarite worship vies for primacy in the Empire.
[ ] Taal: God of the Wilds, husband of Rhya.
[ ] Rhya: Goddess of Agriculture and Birth, wife of Taal.
[ ] Manann: God of the Sea, son of Taal and Rhya. Not very useful inland.

[ ] Morr: God of Death, husband of Verena.
[ ] Verena: Goddess of Justice and Learning, wife of Morr.
[ ] Myrmidia: Goddess of Warfare and Strategy, rarely worshipped in the Empire due to primacy of Ulric and Sigmar. Daughter of Morr and Verena.
[ ] Shallya: Goddess of Mercy and Healing, daughter of Morr and Verena.

[ ] Many: All gods of the Empire have their place, and you call on them as needed.
[ ] None: Well, not actually none. You go to church often enough to keep people off your back and know a prayer or two, and in a tight spot you'll probably call on one or two. Maybe at some point you'll find a god that will resonate with you.
[ ] No, really, none: Well, if you insist. Atheism is usually not looked upon kindly in the Empire, but Grey Wizards have a long track record of keeping out of religion.

[ ] Ranald: Trickster God of luck, fortune, and thieves. Barely tolerated by polite society.
[ ] Khaine: God of Blood, Battle and Murder, believed by some to be the brother of Morr. Khaine cults sometimes crop up among soldiers and mercenaries, and though made infamous by the worship of the Dark Elves, the High and Wood Elves also pay homage to him. It's the sort of thing best kept to oneself.


Spells:

You are not a battle wizard. You cannot summon portals to hell dimensions that eat dozens of men at a time.

...yet.

For Petty and Lesser magics, these are not the only spells you know; they are just the ones you have been actively using since you learned them and can cast well and on the fly. You can brush up on other small magics, if necessary.

Your Shadow Magic spells were the spells you mastered to prove yourself worthy of the title of Journeyman and ready to head out into the world.


Petty Magics, choose one:

[ ] Light: You can either cause items to glow, or create independent lights that move based on your desire, though you lose control of them once they're out of line of sight.
[ ] Sound: You can create any noise but speech from anywhere within line of sight - though the greater the distance, the trickier it is to pull off.


Lesser Magics, choose one:

[ ] Combat: You can wrap magic around yourself to act as armour, and around a weapon to enchant it to deal damage to magical creatures.
[ ] Quash: You can magically silence someone at a distance for a handful of seconds, and attempt to dispel magic within touching distance.
[ ] Security: You can enchant locks so they cannot be picked for a week, and set magical tripwires that alert you if they are crossed.


Shadow Magic, choose two:

[ ] Bewilder: A target, if lacking the mental fortitude to shrug off the effects, will have their mind clouded and will act unpredictably.
[ ] Doppelganger: You take on the appearance of a specific humanoid creature for around half an hour, though not their voice.
[ ] Eye of the Beholder: You can change something's appearance to make it look either worthless or valuable for several hours.
[ ] Mindhole: You attempt to mentally overpower your target, who must be reasonably close. If successful, they will forget everything they know of you.
[ ] Mutable Visage: You can make a target you are touching (or yourself) noticeably more or less attractive for several hours.
[ ] Shadowcloak: Makes you harder to detect for several minutes.
[ ] Shadowsteed: A mystical and supernaturally fast horse is summoned that will carry you or one you designate until dismounted or dawn the next day.





SHINIES

You spent all your shinies in the previous stage of character creation; as it would break my heart if I went to all the trouble to write all the below and you didn't choose to take anything, I am awarding one (1) bonus shiny.

You can also earn extra shinies by taking on additional burdens. Keep in mind that these are all major problems to have - try not to go too crazy. Because of the importance of balancing these, the rest of the options in this post will be voted on in Plan format, and there will be a six hour moratorium on voting. If there's anything special that's not on here that you really want, ask and I'll either stat it or say why not.

[ ] Very Divided Loyalties: Go back to the first post and pick another motivation for +3 shinies.

[ ] Snakehunted: Attracted by miscast Shadowmancy, a Wisdom's Asp has been pursuing you for as long as you can remember, and until defeated (can it be defeated?) it will continue to grin back at you through mirrors and try to sneak into your bed at night to squeeze the life from you. +2 shinies

[ ] Perpetual Apprentice: You have already reached the peak of your magical potential, and will never learn more spells or attain greater magical power than you currently have. +2 shinies

[ ] Hunted Witch: For reasons unknown to you, the local witch hunters are itching for any excuse to purge you. Better win them over or get some powerful allies quickly. +2 shinies

[ ] Ranald's Debt: You can go up to three shinies in debt, but each will turn a failure into a critical glitch at a time most amusing to the Trickster God.

[ ] A More Mundane Debt: You are deep in debt to the Colleges of Magic for your education. They will expect you to start repaying it soon. You don't want to find out what they do to collect on outstanding student loans. Can be taken up to three times for +1 shiny each.

[ ] Arcane Mark: A past fumble with shadow magic has left you permanently changed. Will be rolled randomly; results vary in severity but almost all will leave normal people uneasy around you. +1 shiny, can only be taken once


With your shinies restocked, each of them can be traded in for one item from the following categories:

Mystical:

[ ] Home: As soon as you returned to Stirland, you felt the omnipresent mists rush into your soul and revitalize you. This is the land of shadows, and you are a mage of shadows. Bonus to magic within Stirland itself, penalties to magic outside of it.

[ ] Apothecary: You have the equipment and the training to brew potions and identify useful ingredients, though you will have to experiment or research to find what you can do with local sources.

[ ] Power Mist: Showing a shocking amount of hubris, during your apprenticeship you managed to get your hands on a restricted book and tried to construct a Power Stone. Though you didn't even get close and knocked yourself out for weeks, you did somehow manage to grab and wrestle a strand of Ulgu back on itself until a mist formed, though you passed out soon after. Perhaps this 'power mist' could be contained and investigated for useful properties? And you do remember the rest of the steps, if you're ever arrogant enough to try the whole process again.

[ ] Ritualist: You know the basics of ritual magic, and if given a few months to a year to research, may be able to figure out how to enact large-scale changes to a significant area. Whether those changes are the ones you originally envisioned is entirely up to the whims of the circuitous and contradictory logic of ritual magic.

[ ] Enchanter: You have a talent for taming the winds of Ulgu and trapping them within objects. You can create very minor magical trinkets, and have a bonus to learning the more advanced forms of enchantment.


Physical:

[ ] Tall: You stand a head above most, giving you an edge in combat and a little bit of extra respect from everyone that has to lean backwards to look you in the eye. +2 martial, bonus to relations with anyone that respects size, bonus to intimidation attempts
[ ] Extremely Short: Not just a little shorter than most, but significantly so, comparable to a child, a halfling or a dwarf. Being overlooked is infuriating, but often useful. -2 martial, +4 intrigue, bonus to halfling and dwarf relations but malus to leading humans and other tall creatures.
[ ] Strong: A very straightforward advantage. +4 martial


Mental:

[ ] Animal Kinship: You have a gift for getting along with and training animals. Regular animals, that is; it'd take a lot of work and luck to apply the knack to, say, hippogryphs. +1 Diplomacy
[ ] Brave: You can withstand terrors that make others flee. +1 martial
[ ] Eidetic Memory: Unless severely distracted, you are able to memorize anything at a glance and recall it in perfect detail later. +1 Scholarship
[ ] Gossipmonger: You have a knack for keeping one ear on the buzz of gossip all around you, giving you early warnings when something isn't quite right in your immediate vicinity and a source of low-level local information. +1 Intrigue
[ ] Loyal: You're no less beholden to what drives you, but you've convinced yourself it's not actually a division of loyalties, and if forced, you can explain why with the ring of belief. Perhaps a more accurate name would be 'self-deception'. +1 Faith
[ ] Organized: Through habit or obsession, you keep everything neat, tidy, and in its place. +1 Stewardship
[ ] Polyglot: You easily pick up new languages. +1 Diplomacy
[ ] Quick: You're naturally brighter than the average person. +1 to all stats, though no more nebulous advantages like the other mental traits
[ ] Supernumerate: You can crunch numbers with ease, making bookkeeping and trigonometry a snap. +1 Stewardship
[ ] Superstitious: You know a hundred different superstitions for averting bad luck and keeping the evil eye off you. Maybe some of them work. +1 Faith
[ ] Touched by Death: In your youth in Stirland, you lost loved ones to the attacks of the undead. As an adult, the resulting fear has been reforged into hatred. +1 Martial


Connection:

[ ] Priesthood: Before the gift of magic was found within you, you were considering induction into the ranks of the Priesthood of Morr. The local priests remember you, and you remember the rites and prayers.
[ ] Knights: Though it is hard to read affection in someone covered in black metal who has taken an oath of silence, they have it for you. If life had gone differently, you may have joined their ranks.
[ ] Townsfolk: You know Wurtbad and it's people like the back of your hand, and they will be quick to overcome their suspicion of your new, magical aspect and accept you as one of them once more.
[ ] College: You made friends and allies back in Altdorf, and they may be able to help with research and resources, though the road from Wurtbad to Altdorf is long and treacherous.
[-] Peasants: You know the traditions and superstitions of the people of Stirland, how to talk to them without them seeing you as an outsider or a threat. - FREE DUE TO PEASANT ORIGIN


THERE IS A SIX HOUR MORATORIUM ON VOTING. WHEN VOTING IS OPEN, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT SHINY EXPENDITURE MUST BE IN THE FORM OF A PLAN. GENDER, FAITH AND SPELLS ARE TO BE VOTED ON AS NORMAL.

As before, if there's something you would like added, say so and I'll stat it. Because of the moratorium, I'll be leaving this voting stage up for at least a day so that all the time zones have a chance to weigh in.

Unspent shinies will result in very fortunate occurrences in the first few years; overspent shinies will result in the opposite. Protip: think long and hard before you give the GM free reign to apply a critglitch wherever he pleases with a clean conscience.
