<br/>
Olivia watched Inko stare at her with open jawed confusion, stroking Roggenrola as she waited. Whatever a "<i>Kosei</i>" was, the idea of someone not knowing what one was was clearly alien to her. The idea of alternate dimensions probably hadn't even crossed her mind. And Olivia had little doubt that was what happened. Izuku, somehow, was capable of forcing Ultra Wormholes into existence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Aether Foundation was going to lose their mind when they found out about this one. They had been studying Ultra Wormholes since coming to Alola. The idea of a boy who could open them at will would cause them to come salivating. And while, in her short time as Kahuna, Olivia had worked closely with Aether… Faba was about trustworthy as a Sliggoo… and that was being unfair to the Sliggoo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was, perhaps unsurprisingly, Izuku who recovered from the shock before his mother, "You don't know what a <i>Kosei</i> is, Olivia?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"No, I don't," Olivia said with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Huh," he said, hand coming to rest over his mouth as if he was considering his whole world view. Then just as quickly, he dropped his hand and nodded, "Well, <i>Kosei</i> are the powers we all have! Like I have my portal punch and Mom has her tele- tele, she's able to pull things to her."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was <i>Kosei</i> what they called psychic abilities then? Were psychic abilities common on this earth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Then I have no <i>Kosei.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia didn't appreciate the almost pitying look sent her way by Inko. So she didn't have Psychic powers, was it really that big a deal in this world?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, Ok… but your Pokemon have <i>Kosei</i>?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm not a <i>Kosei</i>-type trainer. I'm a Rock-Type. Hey, no offense, but shouldn't you be getting to bed, kiddo? It's getting late."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You should have been in bed a while ago," Inko agreed, "We can continue this conversation tomorrow, if Olivia is fine with it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm fine with that. I'll show up at the same place tomorrow, so just open up a Ultra Wormhole there."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ok!" Izuku chirped, taking Blanket's hand, "C'mon, Blanket, it's time for bed."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Tar!" Blanket said, other hand reaching up to rub his bloated stomach as he followed Izuku to their bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that would give Olivia time to make sure she wasn't really screwing up with the <i>Kosei</i> talk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Inko looked down at Izuku laying in his bed with 'Blanket', arms wrapped around the small imp and a smile on his face. She sighed and pulled the comforter over the duo, watching Blanket snuggle into the grip and warmth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She got the distinct feeling her mind had been made up before she had even known about Blanket. Izuku clearly already loved the thing to pieces. Stifling a sigh, she went over to call Hisashi and let him know about their new family member. She didn't know what Blanket was, but he was clearly here to stay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia stepped out of the Ultra Wormhole with the "Dug" in her arms and Roggenrola walking around at her feet. Crouching down to bury the Dugtrio in the dirt, she didn't look up at the sound of approaching feet, "Hello, Faba."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Olivia," a smarmy voice came towards her, and caused "Dug" to duck behind her leg. Olivia stood up, staring through the green lenses of the Aether Foundation scientist, "What are you doing so close to so many Ultra Wormholes, so soon after each other?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia would be lying if she said she wasn't really, really tempted to play dumb just to watch Faba's reaction, before deciding it wasn't worth shooting her relationship with the Aether Foundation in the foot for a few minutes of satisfaction, "I happened to be doing a routine cleanout of invasive species when I came across the source of those Wormholes."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"What? You came across an Ultra Beast?* Faba took a step forward, a hungry look in his eyes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"No, I didn't," Oliva said, "The source was something else entirely, and none of your business."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"We have an agreement, Olivia," Faba's smug voice got, if anything, smugger, "That you would turn over anything that could help with the discovery of the relationship between Alola and the Ultra Wormhole phenomenon-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"-assuming Tapu Lele consents. I haven't had time to consult them, so I can't turn over the information to you, Faba. You don't want Aether Paradise destroyed because you angered the Island Guardians, do you?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia took a spike of joy at watching Faba look like he was going to suffer a stroke from pure rage, face flushing and hands lifting like he wanted to throttle her, "Surely, you can make an exception just this once, Olivia? There's never been a case of so many Ultra Wormholes opening in a row before!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And let him even touch Izuku before she could get some sort of protection covering the poor kid who didn't realize how far into a political nightmare his "Kosei" had landed him? In his dreams.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I respect the work Aether does for Alola, Faba, I really do. However, I will not put the people of both Aether Paradise and Akala Island in danger because <i>you</i> want to rush things. I am the Kahuna of Akala, the safety and spiritual needs of its people are my first, last and only concerns, <i>not</i> what you want."</div>
