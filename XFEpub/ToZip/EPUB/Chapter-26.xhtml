<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">[X]Deployment Plan<br/>
-[X]All Vehciles in each zone are piloted by Scout Marines where possible.<br/>
-[X]Position A: 2 Razorbacks (Standard), 1 Razorback (Twin-Linked Assault Cannon), 10 assault bikes, Cyrus, &amp; the 10th Company, 2 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Heavy Bolters), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Lascannons) , 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Hyperion AA), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Assault Cannons), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Multi-Melta). Tarantulas deployed at Cyrus' discretion.<br/>
-[X]Position B: 1 Whirlwind, deployed inside the fortress. All 5 Land Speeders.<br/>
-[X]Position C: 4 Thunderhawks, after deploying units. (The other two need to be in position to deploy Tarantulas)<br/>
-[X]Position D: 1 Tarantula (Heavy Bolter) &amp; 1 Tarantula (Twin-Linked Assault Cannon) to be deployed at Col. Merrik's choice.<br/>
-[X]Position E: Gabriel &amp; Apollo, Codicier, Techmarine, 5th Company, Predator, 1 Razorback (Standard), 1 Razorback (Twin-linked Plasmagun + Lascannon), 2 Rhinos, 2 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Heavy Bolters), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Lascannons) , 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Hyperion AA), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Twin-Linked Assault Cannons), 1 Tarantula Sentry Gun (Multi-Melta). Tarantulas deployed at Gabriel's discretion.<br/>
<br/>
[X]Engagement Plan<br/>
-[X]Position A: Engage the Feral Orks attacking the fortress. Assassinate whatever leader(s) are at the front to demoralize the Greenskins. Drive them from the field (or at least to the point where the Knights &amp; Mechanicus can hold the line), then scout the Forests to find the Ork base. Destroy it.<br/>
-[X]Position B: Land Speeders are to harass and destroy Ork Artillery positions. Spot for the Whirlwind if good targets are found, or if local defenses are too much for the speeder alone. Land Speeder Tempests can engage Looted Tanks if the opportunity arises.<br/>
-[X]Position C: Thunderhawks provide air support. Focus on the Squiggoth. (I wish these had Turbolasers)<br/>
-[X]Position D: Trust in the strength of our fellow Man.<br/>
-[X]Position E: Deploy via Drop Pods. Crush the Greenskin filth with the Emperor's Boot. If an enemy Boss appears, Apollo or Gabriel will destroy them.<br/>
-[X]Position F: If we gain permission, commence orbital bombardment. Don't do it if the Librarians scry something too important.<br/>
<br/>
[X]Use the powers of the Librarians to:<br/>
-[X] Search for greater intelligence and information on the goings on at Position F<br/>
<br/>
[X] 85th Vendoland is to deploy at Position D to defend House Baroon. Let them know the enemy force composition so they don't bring too many Anti-Armor weapons.<br/>
<br/>
[X] Inform House Myrlen that we are arriving Via Drop pod to assist in their defense. Also ask if we have permission to commence Orbital Bombardment on Position F.</div>

<div style="text-align: center"><b>In The Name Of The Emperor<br/>
+004.M42+<br/>
+<i>Honour Your Chapter</i>+<br/>
</b>​</div>The prideful Knights of the world were not stupid despite their actions. For in truth some time ago many had given up on the hope of freeing their world and protecting their charges from the greenskin filth. For all their piping up of surety that the foe would be defeated long years and campaigning had easily taught them that howled defiance without the numbers or weaponry to back it up was but wind. The vast majority of Imperial forces for not just the Subsector but the Sector as a whole had been spread out across the Eastern Fringe and what little remained was now marshalling for the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade. There was no one to aid them, or so they had thought. Even the feverish piety of the Sisters of Battle could not make up for the damages that their world had suffered from the recent tyranid incursions. The Mechanicus was inexplicable and strange despite the bonds between Trontiux II’s Knightly Houses and Forgeworld Zerann. It was unknown if they would arrive at all.<br/>
<br/>
They had elected, perhaps foolishly, to try and make a noble sacrifice and slay as many of the filthy xenos as they could for the future Imperial forces who would no doubt someday try to reclaim the system.<br/>
<br/>
None of which mattered due to the vagaries of the warp, many had felt. Who knew if the whims of fate might prevent any potential relief force from reaching them. The only other force that might have reached them was the Blood Ravens…but <i>none</i> in the Sector could trust the <i>Blood Ravens</i>. Proud defenders of the Imperium they might have been the stink and rot of heresy hung about every deed, every banner, every word that passed from their lips. On the words of two different Inquisitors had they been judged purged and cleansed but fear and hatred were ever easier to build than trust so badly mauled. As it was, however, when the Mechanicus <i>did</i> emerge from the warp, hurried communications between astropaths bringing the knowledge that the Angels of Death – maligned as these ones were – were accepted with stoicism and worry in equal measure.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Zerann’s word was as good as law, and so the pride of the Knights was subsumed by the unyielding need to protect their precious machines and deal out death to the xenos in equal measure. Besides which it was not as if they could have <i>prevented</i> the Blood Ravens and surprisingly a regiment of Imperial Guard from landing. Too much territory had been lost to the orks. Frankly, some of the heads of households thought, if the Blood Ravens wanted to try and root out the greenskins they were more than welcome to try.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">============================================<br/>​</div>“Come, you monstrous tide, come unto me and <i>die</i>,” growled the weary Preceptor Legrin.<br/>
<br/>
Bloodshot eyes glared out through the limited optics his knight still possessed out towards the seemingly endless tide which charged forward without a care for honor or proper rites of combat. For all that his mind <i>ached</i> under the strain for fighting as long as he had within his machine he could not rest, not yet. Despite their lack of major weaponry by sheer numbers had the creatures managed the absurd feat of damaging him – not <i>him</i>, the machine – even if part of it was by exhaustion. Great rents had been dealt to every Knight present as the damn thing charged forward to try and crawl about them. With a great blast of his – <i>the machines </i>– gun, the battlecannon tore yet another group of them to shreds.<br/>
<br/>
But there were more.<br/>
<br/>
There were <i>always</i> more.<br/>
<br/>
“Preceptor,” called out one of the few remaining of his court, Baron Aryon, “You must rest! You have not exited your knight for days now!”<br/>
<br/>
“I will rest when I am <i>dead</i>,” the leader of the House snarled, “Which if this keeps up will be soon enough!”<br/>
<br/>
Knights should have been enough against this foe. They had been for as long as he could remember in the <i>past</i> – but the fact of the matter was that they had not been prepared for the orks to become so flush under the leadership of a Warboss and his WAAAGH! who had appeared out of the damned warp <i>itself</i>. But now, now so many of those citizens he was responsible for were dead and that more than anything else shamed him. The lack of preparedness for all of this was one thing, the fact that he had not deployed his forces fast enough against a foe they had underestimated all this time was another, but the <i>failure</i> was what burned in his reactor core – his <i>heart</i>, damn it.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his words to his subordinate, he did not fool himself. He had been too long bonded in the machine without breaks or respite. The bleed through was…not pleasant, he found.<br/>
<br/>
It was about that moment that sensors throughout the fortress and even within his own armor blared out warnings of incoming airborne objects.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">​</div>“What-,” his thoughts felt like they accelerated and slowed at the same time as several of those same objects slammed into the earth around the perimeter of the stronghold he’d spent his life living in.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The Mechanicus!</i><br/>
<br/>
But it was not the Mechanicus, despite the messages that he had heard a short time ago and nearly dismissed out of exhaustion as a hallucination. Nor was it the Imperial Guard.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Angels of Death.<br/>
<br/>
A sudden explosion of cannon and bolter fire ripped out of the rising clouds of dust before anything within could even be sighted, tearing apart the incoming horde almost immediately. From the skies, thunderhawk transporters slammed down their razorback cargos and lent their own weapons to clearing out the enemy as well. From the razorbacks came new fusillades of death unleashed from the armaments aboard them and then – in movements that were notably jerky and a slight bit uncertain – came the neophytes and aspirants of the Blood Ravens.<br/>
<br/>
Some would consider it callous that the Captain of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company would be willing to throw them into battle in such numbers, until one remembered the limited gene-seed available to the chapter. For one who had seen some of the worst the galaxy had to offer the brave sons of the Emperor, it was better for them to all meet their fates in battle before they grew too old to be properly implanted. Better to winnow the weak from the young before them, for the betterment of the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Within seconds, some had fallen, torn to shreds by primitive arrows fired from inhuman arms. Others fired with bolter and flamer and wrenched out an admirable tally of their own. These alone were supported by a charge of machine steeds led by the most experienced amongst the company, at the head of which was Cyrus himself. Under an unrelenting and shockingly powerful assault from the front and the subsequent endless flanking, retreating, and flanking maneuvers of the assault bikes, the orks were to the stupefied Knights present, broken.<br/>
<br/>
Cyrus momentarily brought his assault bike to a halt and rose from it, sighting down his sniper rifle as the last of the orks disappeared in the distance…to an unmodified human eye perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
“You-you have rescued us,” Preceptor Legrin finally rumbled from within his machine, his shock practically freezing the man. “We-I-,”<br/>
<br/>
“Attention, all 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company. Move out in pursuit. Drive them back into the forests themselves.”<br/>
<br/>
Cyrus moved his hand slightly, deactivating coms, and looked up to the ravaged knights of House Legrin, and more specifically to their leader. He nodded once, and said no more before gunning the engine of his bike and moving out with the rest of his company behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Across Trontiux, the news was the same.<br/>
<br/>
“The Blood Ravens have come!”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==================================<br/>​</div>At House Aerian, five landspeeders ran endless diversions and delivered punishing runs upon the enemy infantry present while staying out of the accurate range of the greenskins, or so it was assumed until a looted Imperial hydra brought one crashing down near the walls of the fortress. Though the two pilots survived and the wreck was dragged out of way from the grasping hands of the ork meks, the whirlwind deployed within the fortress itself was more than capable of bringing holy fury down upon the xenos to the loud appreciation of the House and those it protected. Thusly chastised, the Blood Ravens turned their attentions to the enemy artillery and brought them retribution in a combination of landspeeder tempests and whirlwind fire. Within the protected bounds of the fortress and granted a position one a high tower outside of the range of the enemy, firing solutions brought by the accurate observations of the remaining – and now slightly more cautious landspeeders – ensured that even looted Leman Russ tanks were blown to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
With the landspeeders in defense and the noble whirlwind providing creeping bombardment, for the first time in months did any Knight on Trontiux II manage to go on the <i>attack</i>. All five Knights of House Aerian stormed forward and brought their formidable weaponry to bear against the enemy teleporter base. Defensive cannons and strange lightning weaponry were activated in the same instant, bringing two of the five Knights to their knees, but before the power of the whirlwind and the carving power of the close combat weaponry of House Aerian did the enemy base be rent asunder.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">============================<br/>​</div>It was at House Xerult that the Mechanicus elected to deploy a significant number of their own forces. The Tech Guard arrived and in screaming binary did they unleash the great fury of the Mechanicus at the xenos for daring to harm the holy machines upon the world. With the knowledge that the Blood Ravens would be spread out amongst numerous other Houses, the Mechanicus arrived at the House that had already lost two of their machines to the enemy in an effort to prevent worse losses. Great cyborgs clad in weaponry that would make a mere Guardsman weep strode forth, letting loose with phosphor and rare volkite rifles to decimate the enemy within the first minute of engagement.<br/>
<br/>
Nobs who dared to rise up and try and rally their brethren were consequently struck down, advanced targeting algorithms locating them on their screams and the imperceptible shift in physiology of the greenskins as they sought a leader. Roaring in righteous fury, a myrmidon techpriest stalked onto the battlefield, an ax whose cog shaped blade was shimmering with lightning and death crashing through a charging orks choppa and the ork behind it in a half second of effort while over half a dozen guns attached to their mechadendrites fired endless salvos against the suddenly blunted tide.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the inhuman abilities of their pilots, even thunderhawks could be vulnerable to the sheer volume of crude shells and flak made of scrap metal rose up from the gargant looking structure from which the endless teleported tide of tanks and ork food soldiers was spewed upon the plains. A wing strut here, dents and cracks across the hull there and for one astoundingly lucky piloting marine a former tank gun barrel was shot through the cockpit and almost skewered him and instead only knocked his copilot unconscious with almost mortal lacerations and broken bones.<br/>
<br/>
Yet they continued on their course, focusing fire on the squiggoth who was in the process of tearing down the walls of the fortress while the two remaining Knights were focused on another breach caused by tank fire and psyker assault. The great beast whined and gurgled as one particularly vindictive thunderhawk fired their full payload straight down its throat. Even as the turrets upon its back fired back in turn a second, then a third thunderhawk struck at it.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=====================================<br/>​</div>The Imperial Guard came down with far less fanfare and expert annihilation of the enemy, but with the never wavering determination of the best of their kind. Multiple marauder-based bombing runs broke the back of the enemy at the front while valkyries came to a halt just within the walls of the fortress. While Colonel Merrick made his way to speak with their representatives the rest of his troops fell out to their assigned positions, heavy artillery setting up with tanks surrounding them while heavy weapons teams took to hills and positions along the walls. They were not the Angels of Death, nor were they the unyielding legions of the Mechanicus.<br/>
<br/>
They were Imperial Guard, and they would serve the Holy Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
Though the sudden arrival of two additional tarantula turrets certainly helped.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==========================================<br/>​</div>“Stand and fight, my brothers!”<br/>
<br/>
The Exalted Court of House Myrlen were, despite the odds, still standing. Rockets blasted forth from their pods, while battle cannons brought ruination to the enemy who had swarmed the walls. A phalanx of looted tanks belched smoke and slug based gunfire as they roared through the breaches in the walls where a tower had once stood. The aging Preceptor Myrlen consequently brought down a foot and then a massive blade onto them, crushing them quite literally under his feet. For where the walls of House Myrlen were broken and shattered in over a dozen places their Knights had refused to give up the fight.<br/>
<br/>
“Get the rest of our people into the central keep, at least the shields <i>there</i> haven’t failed yet!”<br/>
<br/>
“Come on! Come on,” shrieked his son, bodily blocking a breach with his entire Knight and letting loose with every weapon system he could. “You will <i>not take House Myrlen</i>!”<br/>
<br/>
Preceptor Myrlen chuckled at the hot bloodedness of his boy and stomped backwards to absentmindedly plant the foot of his machine atop a charging war track.<br/>
<br/>
“Preceptor?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, yes,” he turned slightly to look at the sky, “The ‘<i>Angels of Death</i>’, are you to come and aid us in our time of need?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes. We require clear zones for drop pod descent.”<br/>
<br/>
“And you have them,” he agreed, designating zones with command-speak, lighting them up in his mind and thus in the systems of his reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==========================================<br/>​</div>High above the world, within the <i>Litany of Fury</i>, a lone Lexicani nervously stood. It was a nervousness that would otherwise be beyond one of the mighty Astartes of the Imperium save for the fact that the once grand and well populated Librarium was down to so few. In the past the combined psychic power of the chapter had been a comforting constant in the background of his mind and soul. A quiet melody that only he and his compatriots could hear – though for some the phenomenon did not manifest as a song as it did to him – that was gone now. Those that remained as Lexicani were far too weak in their powers to truly recreate the chorus. So now…now it was just him. The rest of his peers were spread out across the rest of the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Well.<br/>
<br/>
And Epistolary Maphar, who entered without fanfare save for a single pneumatic hiss from his new arm.<br/>
<br/>
“Lexicani Achillian,” he greeted.<br/>
<br/>
“Epistolary Maphar,” Achillian nodded in turn. “I have prepared everything for the scrying ritual.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then I shall begin. <i>You</i> shall join me.”<br/>
<br/>
Achillian started, and stared at the Epistolary.<br/>
<br/>
“I…no I was told to simply prepare the materials – I have nowhere near the-the training to-,”<br/>
<br/>
“Silence, Lexicani,” Maphar placed his bionic hand onto the somewhat smaller Lexicani’s shoulder. “You are aware that our ranks must be rebuilt.”<br/>
<br/>
“I-I am, but-,”<br/>
<br/>
“We cannot advance you nor your brothers from the position of Lexicani without the works and experience required. So. You shall <i>aid</i> me Lexicani.”<br/>
<br/>
And so they began their ritual.<br/>
<br/>
With a great twisting of psychic energies and ritualistic intonation, the great beacon of power that was the <i>Sanctorium Arcanum</i> flickering deep within its vault a backdrop thrumming power, they peered through the veil of Materium and Immaterium in tandem. Daemons cackled in the edge of his mind’s eye as they always did whenever they exercised their powers and struggled against him. Alone he might have collapsed under the weight of the great ocean of them that surrounded the Litany of Fury and its beacon, but for the steady presence of Maphar beating them back. Down below, they peered into the darkness…<br/>
<br/>
“Ah!”<br/>
<br/>
Achillian screamed as his eyes exploded in their sockets, Maphar staggering to the side as a brutish <i>fist</i> of furious green energies crashed through the warp itself in defiance of their looking. Far below, in the mountains of the world below, a thuggish laugh could be heard through the spaces of non-physical which boomed so loudly in their ears that it left them bleeding. Even as the Epistolary growled and reset his feet, slamming his staff into the floor and thrusting his hand forth once more to the planet below, Achillian hissed as he made it to his knees, a fist slamming onto the ground in anger.<br/>
<br/>
Hatred sparked in him then. It had been his <i>first</i> major combat operation besides the frantic disgusting conflict that had been the Purge of the chapter, and it had been a xenos that had done this to him?!<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Achillian mumbled whilst Maphar silently struggled against the sudden and unexpected psyker assault from below. “I will not…you will <i>not</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
“YOU CANNOT KEEP US FROM YOU!” He howled as he stood then and though his soul ached and almost literally burned with the effort he added his strength to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Down below, the shaman atop his copper tower and surrounded by dozens of lesser brethren, abruptly wheezed as a fist clenched around his exposed brain and opened skull. A fist made of cerulean fire which then clenched. Green lightning blasted out of the dead ork as the powers contained within that emerald flesh were fully unleashed. Around him the rest of the chanting and stomping shamans were broken apart from their own mindless efforts by the explosion of gore and psychic energies. The chain reaction was…just as violent as any greenskin could have wished in a death. More valuable however was the disappearance of the aura of clouding green which had so blocked auspex scans and even the efforts of the astropaths and sanctioned psykers available to all those who had tried before now.<br/>
<br/>
But few could match the unbridled powers of the Librarians of the Blood Ravens.<br/>
<br/>
Nero Achillian struggled to his feet, eye sockets still bleeding, but with a victorious grin on his face as the fog disappeared. For now despite the atmospheric interference they could <i>see</i>.<br/>
<br/>
“Thus,” he hissed, “Revelation.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=======================================<br/>​</div>You relish this, you realize.<br/>
<br/>
It has been too long since you campaigned out. The Blood Ravens could not exist in the vacuum that was Subsector Aurelia. The foes of the Imperium were numberless and remaining sequestered in Subsector Aurelia was <i>not</i> how you could serve it. There had been work to do there and you did it. Now what was left was the work of the Guard and PDF. Now you were here, doing the Emperors work. With a slam of your hammer you struck an ork nob hard enough to crush its skull and pulverize its body. With your free hand you grabbed a charging xeno’s wrist and flipped them behind you.<br/>
<br/>
Apollo served to be more than enough to deal with <i>that</i> one.<br/>
<br/>
“<i>Burn!</i>”<br/>
<br/>
A great wave of fire slashed its way across the charging greenskins from the hands of the Codicier that you had brought along with you. For a single instant does melancholy strike you, remembering the days of you and Isador in the battles of the past. Then you see the lack of sheer contempt, the pure hatred untainted by the dark touch of Chaos. It is better that way.<br/>
<br/>
“The orks are breaking, Chapter Master, they are retreating!” The seemingly forever cheerful voice of the Preceptor booms out of his Knight. “Ah, a wondrous sight! Though it shall take use weeks to clear out their filthy taint and scrub the lands clean of them fully.”<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” the voice of Epistolary Maphar suddenly appears from your com bead, “We have pierced the veil over the mountains. It was being maintained by…an orkish psyker, a group of them.”<br/>
<br/>
You blink but move past that thought in the next instant.<br/>
<br/>
“And?”<br/>
<br/>
“They have created a Gargant. Not one of those strange bases upon the plains but a true Gargant. The Warboss himself commands from atop it.”<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ah</i>, interesting. Before you can speak again the great noise of Preceptor’s approach reaches you.<br/>
<br/>
“You speak of the mountains to the south! Ah, yes. We tried, in the past, to strike them where they landed. We…,” he coughed which certainly sounded odd coming from the speakers upon a Knight’s frame, “We failed, in that. Their numbers and machines were too great for us…a shameful defeat indeed!”<br/>
<br/>
“But father! Now that the reinforcements have arrived, and the other Houses are better secured, we could-,”<br/>
<br/>
You’ve never seen a Knight backhanded before, but there it is.<br/>
<br/>
“Silence, boy! Let the Angels of Death do their work, and let us see to securing our people! Are you so foolish to leave our charges alone!?”<br/>
<br/>
He then turns and manages to point the tip of his massive blade at you with near impossible dexterity.<br/>
<br/>
“There are many Knights down there, my friend. Their remains are cracked and broken and I have little doubt that the greenskins have not turned at least some of them to scrap, but there are likely some that are still present. I recall seeing two Knights crushed beneath an avalanche on our retreat, from Aerian perhaps? Or was it another? Hmm…nevertheless, I know that you may desire to strike them with holy fire from on high.”<br/>
<br/>
His Knight leans forward ever so slightly.<br/>
<br/>
“You must not do this, lest those hulks be destroyed,” his cheeriness disappears entirely with those words. “They must be <i>recovered</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
This is, you remember then, a Mechanicus-aligned Knightly World. Of course they would prioritize the reclamation and preservation of their technologies to an extent that an Imperial Knightly World would not. Worse, this is a Mechanicus-headed operation that you have been brought into as allies and not principal leaders. It could potentially cost you a great amount of influence with them if you attempted to bombard the site from orbit as you had originally wished and in the process ended up destroying those some hulks.<br/>
<br/>
“…I see.”<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” Maphar speaks up again, “We can…see them. Lexi-…<i>Codicier</i> Achillian can see the remains of a half dozen Knights trapped beneath the earth, and another half dozen more in the possession of the orks themselves.”<br/>
<br/>
“Codicier Achillian,” you repeat, surprise clear in your voice, “He can view the wrecks themselves?”<br/>
<br/>
“With surprising clarity, Chapter Master.”<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
“Even with his eyes destroyed,” he bemusedly adds.<br/>
<br/>
“What?”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">======================================<br/>​</div>Only an hour later, you’ve learned your assumptions were correct.<br/>
<br/>
Magos Verillian is…<i>emphatic</i> about you not commit orbital bombardment and risk endangerment of the Knights. Considering the circumstances that brought you here in the first place you are unsure as to whether or not you should proceed or not. It would not be the first time that space marines have performed actions that the Mechanicus disagreed with or vice versa. You could disobey him but the risks of that are more than made manifest to your attentions by his rather emotional yelling.<br/>
<br/>
At the least, the situation on the ground is favorable.<br/>
<br/>
The 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company under Captain Cyrus cleared the feral orks on the field and further spread out into the forests. Stealthy scouts under his leadership managed to locate their stronghold deep into the woods and immediately moved to destroy it with detonation packs. Their leader, a boss upon a horrifically mutated squig-boar hybrid, was brought down by three of said detonation packs and five rounds to the skull from five different sniper rifles. Even with that it is the Captain who is credited with the kill, appearing out of the smoke and slitting the throat of the somehow still living ork.<br/>
<br/>
Every House is secure, though the damage they have suffered is not inconsequential. The Guard have fortified their position, while the Mechanicus have spread themselves out across every single House in order to look over the machines they worship. In great numbers have the tech guard surrounded the houses while their own machines have begun to fortify the land while they repair the damage that has been done. In turn the Knights have turned to resting themselves as there is not a one among them who abandoned their duty to their people and so each is suffering from extreme exhaustion and malnutrition.<br/>
<br/>
The next phase of the fight approaches.<br/>
<br/>
At the least, you will not have to fight it alone. With the news that there are plenty of Knights waiting to be reclaimed, the Mechanicus is marshaling the full brunt of their forces though not to the extent of commanding a Legio Titanicus to walk. It appears that if you let them they are more than willing to overrun the southern mountains without you <i>or</i> the Imperial Guard.<br/>
