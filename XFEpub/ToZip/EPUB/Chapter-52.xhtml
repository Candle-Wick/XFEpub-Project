It was horrifying, and yet it was necessary. They had seen what would be and what needed to be, and they had begun their preparations and responses far sooner and more completely than any other of the lesser races of the galaxy could possibly have done so. In point of fact, they had started long before the ‘war’ such as it could be called had begun. Before the folly of their lesser could even be enacted or even thought of for the first time they had undertaken a great series of preparations for the necessary staging that needed to be set for a trap of truly epic proportions.<br/>
<br/>
The skeins of fate had shifted terribly, and while Eldrad was off pursuing his rituals and ideas of some mad awakening the rest of them had to ensure that the eldar survived. And if the green tide was allowed to grow further and further without true retribution and a halting to its progress than no one in the galaxy would live, the eldar especially. Yet what the mon-keigh had devised was dealt with, not by any but the sheer brutal strength of the one they now sought to stop. While that was obvious, as primitives could not be trusted to lay traps that would succeed in the long term, now that they had come it was simple to begin it all again.<br/>
<br/>
That many of them felt fear crawl in their hearts and deaden their souls with the slightest of touches, that it was a gamble of the highest order, they had to perform their work as best as they could. For should the gaze of the Crimson One, locked deep within the void between stars who blazed with such impossible might they could be extinguished should they but gain even the smallest of grains of his oceanic attention and might. Yet that terrible, terrible gaze was turned inward, on rituals of blasphemy and horror which had captured its energies wholly and with that tainted blessing they went about their work. If anything, the sheer blazing light, corrupted as it was, worked to their advantage as they went about their rituals.<br/>
<br/>
None could deny that the Great Devourer was coming in ever greater numbers, and that the only way to stop it was in methods that they did not dare use. Only the mon-keigh would willingly sacrifice more planets than they to the foe and not one Craftworld was willing to have the same done unto them. As well as they should not have been. They had yet other methods to use, and to prevent the fate of Iyanden from being spread to all they had to do it to the utter best of their abilities. From Splinter to Hive Fleets, they needed to be blunted upon the only weapon that the eldar had found capable of doing so. Not the necron, surely not the mon-keigh.<br/>
<br/>
But it could be fooled. It could be tricked. It could be <i>baited</i>. For while it possessed an unending tide of flesh and chitin at its command, the Hive Mind desired but more to eat. And while even worlds of no life could be consumed for the cores within, they had watched and learned from this new foe. And while the mon-keigh had set his trap, he had not worked to ensure its sustainability. The eldar would do better, their methods far superior. The mon-keigh themselves, the first, had failed surely. But that which was once mon-keigh and had turned to the darkness would serve just as well. It could not even disguise the burning beacon that was its sheer strength and power, a light closer to the edge of the galactic rim and thus to the teeming hordes that starved endlessly than that of what was once called its ‘father’.<br/>
<br/>
And so great runes were carved in secret by teams of troops and seers ferried to and fro by most sophisticated and powerful holo-fielding, to increase the draw of the bait that had so conveniently laid itself bare.  Lengthy rituals were performed by the most powerful of their farseers with their attendants about them to ensure that flesh and psychic might were offered freely up to the Hive Mind which could be drawn to such so very easily. Even the primitive psykers of the orks were used up, to flavor the meal that they displayed openly for the entity which could perceive it the way they wished. Rarely were they seen, and soon after dismissed as ghosts by an empire left emptied out for the whims of the one who had become its master.<br/>
<br/>
It was not wholly unseen, of course. Despite their best efforts, the universe itself seemed to act against them at times ever since The Fall. By sheer numbers, by technologies that they could not afford to ignore the disturbing growth in memory from so long ago, they were discovered at times. Waves of eyes that greedily held brutal weapons in hand to fall upon guardians, for heavy tanks and machines that stomped forth through dark reaper fire even as the farseers frantically performed their works. In one truly terrible occasion one of the ships through which they were ferried across an entire orkish empire was discovered and torn apart by a dozen of massive ‘kroozers’ as the orks said in their own parlance.  While the lowly Imperials abominable warriors retreated, their own worlds and other battlefields demanding their attention – those ‘White Scars’, those ‘Salamanders’, those ‘Raven Guard’ it was to the eldar who the responsibility fell to pick up the slack once more.<br/>
<br/>
Of course they were not so stupid as to attempt to rely on but one form of bait. There were other sources as well.<br/>
<br/>
Too busy, spread out as they were, the ‘gleaming realm’ that the mon-keigh were too proud of by far compared to the elegance and wonder that their civilization had once possessed was vulnerable as well. Besides which, already had ‘Ultramar’ faced the Great Devourer, and yet so too had the Ultramarines brought much death to their kind. A perfect solution, then, and one that would enable a greater distraction of their twin enemies in kind. They would scream, they would yell, and they would suffer, but they would kill in turn. Their shame at their near failures in the past to such a foe would drive them in how the puppet masters desired. Those that died in these efforts were to be honored, and that they died to provide further concealment to those that needed it only enhanced their legends and songs.<br/>
<br/>
But far more was successful than failed, and in the end despite the waves of grief that consumed them and the hatred in their hearts, they finished their works. Despite the dead, each one another life that should never have ended so soon, they continued on. How could they not? How could they be but the most stalwart of defenders for the galaxy and the preservers of their race? Against an ork who had begun to harken back to times that none were loath to remember and were more than eager to try and end, against a <i>thing</i> which came from the darkness far beyond their galaxy, they could only perform their works.<br/>
<br/>
To shine, to display, to attract, and as the months passed on with the arrival of the monstrous presence of the red one, they knew what had needed to be done…had been done. The races of their galaxy would likely never truly know what had been done, and those that did were more likely than not too primitive to know its true scope. One of the most obvious of examples was of the dulled Tau Empire’s denizens, who gleefully told themselves lies of how their tactics and precious toy general had led them to victory, to have somehow blunted a Hive Mind that could not be <i>blunted</i>. Of what the foolish mon-keigh had called Behemoth, of Kraken, of Leviathan, came the hungry grasping tendrils, falling upon worlds and worlds that had long already tasted the touch of the Hive Mind’s servants and had more than happily fought to their deaths, they came.<br/>
<br/>
That so many mon-keigh worlds were suddenly from their burdens, of splinters and splinters and splinters leaving meals unfinished for the promise of a true feast, that the Imperium’s vast bleeding to their charmingly named ‘Third Tyrannic War’ was given a stopper to as their foes departed for the true quagmire trap that the noble eldar had set, the true rulers of the galaxy allowed in their magnanimous designs them to believe whatever their little minds could. It did not matter. What mattered was that three entire craftworlds were able to successfully retreat from now suddenly turning fleets that would have destroyed them utterly. What mattered is that five exodite worlds were capable of battling their way to a cleansed freedom as the vast majority of the hordes turned away to hunt for a more enticing prey. What mattered is that where there were but scant billions, now there were tens of billions more on the way, to drag away the attentions of those places master.<br/>
<br/>
And for the deaths of but a comparative few, the greater eldar race would survive, and grow strong in the meantime while their foes brought ruination to one another. As it should be, was once, and would be again. Ulthwé would see to it.</div>
