    <h2>The Battle of Karagril, Part 6</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Plan HUMINT
-[*] ELF: Claim him.
-[*] SKAVEN: Claim him.
-[*] PUPS: Cede them.
-[*] OOZE: Cede it.
-[*] AXE: Split it.
-[*] BOOK: Claim it.
-[*] GOLD: Cede it.



The final agreement was straightforward: you got the prisoners and the book, Johann got his wolf-rat pups, the ooze, and the gold, and you'll split whatever credit ends up being produced by Kragg's investigation. It's a bit strange to walk away from that much gold; perhaps you've finally started to internalize the Grey College's disemphasis on money, or perhaps you're the same faithful of Ranald you've always been, giving up hard cash for the unknowable rewards the other possibilities might offer.

Between their enmity for their ancestral foes and their society that uses Clan pressure to resolve petty crime and exile to deal with anything worse, Dwarves don't really take prisoners that often, but that doesn't mean they're not fully capable of building a prison when asked. At your prompting stone blocks and steel bars are brought into an unused room not terribly far from your quarters in Karag Nar, though it might be wise to put some thought to building something more convenient and permanent before too long. And with both of your captives still held in the grip of Mockery of Death, you finally find an ideal purpose for your earliest magical discovery: Mathilde's Mystical Matrix. With a deft grip on Ulgu, you weave strands of magic inside the torsos of each of your prisoners, and once the web of magical power is complete you lodge within it the fully-formed spell of Mockery of Death. Should either be able to escape from their cages - unlikely, but both Skaven and Druchii are not to be underestimated - they will run into the Alarm on the door, which will both inform you and collapse the Matrix inside of them and unleash the spell it contains.

That takes care of them in the short term, so now it's time to start considering the medium term. They're both yours to interrogate or dispose of as you see fit, and though both could be intriguing sources of intelligence and information, you've already got more avenues of investigation than you know what to do with.

[ ] ELF: Keep him...
- [ ] primarily for the strategic intelligence he could provide.
- [ ] primarily as a source of information about Clan Moulder.
- [ ] primarily as a source of information about the Druchii.
[ ] ELF: Extradite him to Ulthuan.
[ ] ELF: Ransom him to Naggaroth.
[ ] ELF: Send him to the Emperor's Spymaster for questioning.
[ ] ELF: Send him to the Grey College for questioning.

[ ] SKAVEN: Keep him...
- [ ] primarily for the strategic intelligence he could provide.
- [ ] primarily as a source of information on the Skaven.
- [ ] primarily as a source to learn Queekish.
[ ] SKAVEN: Turn him over to the Grey College.
[ ] SKAVEN: Turn him over to the Dwarves.

And if you do end up keeping either of them, their current prison is a bit makeshift. Maybe Dwarf-made is proof enough, or maybe you should work on a longer-term solution.

[ ] CELLS: They'll be fine where they are.
[ ] CELLS: Talk to Princess Edda about building a proper dungeon in Karag Nar.
As well as holding captured enemies, this could be useful in the future as human populations increase and crime starts to be a concern. She may call on you to return the favour at some point in the future.
[ ] CELLS: Use your authority to get the most skilled Dwarven stoneworkers working on a dungeon just for you.
This will excavate two rooms under your quarters and convert one into a prison at no cost to yourself, but Eight Peaks will need to see some benefit from at least one of these prisoners, or your reputation will suffer.

To your surprise and concern, King Belegar made no ceremony of the third sapphire added to his crown; it simply appeared between one day and the next. Despite this, morale at Eight Peaks couldn't be higher, as the Dwarves both local and of Karak Azul take this as proof that the Expedition's success was no fluke, but the start of the new trend that will see the remaining five peaks return to Dwarven control within their lifetimes. You receive a few back-pats yourself, though all for the one semi-competent Warboss you slew in front of everyone and none for all the much more dangerous ones that died without an appreciative audience. The mercenaries were well paid out of Belegar's dwindling stockpile of silver, but many linger instead of returning to the Border Princes, and the silver pours right back into Karag Nar. It seems Princess Edda hasn't had much to do with it, and the EIC was quite happy to step into that vacuum and open up taverns, inns, eateries, and long-term accommodations. The EIC scrupulously pays every ounce of taxes due to Eight Peaks, but the entire profit instead of a taxed portion of it could have been flowing into the Royal Treasury. Though the missed opportunity is to your profit, you're not exactly pleased at what might be the first crack in the multi-species experiment.

[Loremaster Education: 13.]

You manage to tear yourself away from other people's jobs to pay some attention to your own; even though King Belegar gave you the unofficial task of doling out copious violence in Sylvania, your official task was the education and edification of the We, and you carefully considering the mixed news in the reports. Sje√•th seems to have gotten on quite well with the We, finding them as fascinating as they find him interesting, but he hasn't been able to translate Dwarven education techniques into something digestible to the We's alien mindset. He'll be sticking around a while longer to finish writing up what he's learned in the hopes that it might help deepen understanding of bees, but there's no denying he's failed in his task. Not a huge problem, as it was expected it would take some time and a few different approaches until you would find one that fit, but you're not pleased to be reporting failure.

However, with Karag Nar secured, your underground fronts are all against the incredibly occupied Clan Mors and the overground front is a deathtrap that artillerists, pilots, and Maximilian alike all dearly hope an enemy proves foolish enough to try. Though it could change in a moment if the wars underground swing against Clan Mors, until and unless that happens, Eight Peaks is in a position of security that could scarcely be dreamed about during the Expedition. Now is the time to look beyond the immediate fires and start long-term projects for the permanent betterment of Eight Peaks, and possibly beyond.


You can put forward any number of these suggestions, but the more suggestions you make, the less control you have over what Belegar might pick. He may also put forward a plan of his own, if he thinks it particularly important.

[ ] PROJECT: Aethyric Vitae
You're reasonably confident that the magical energies Aethyric Vitae can be made to release could fuel powerful runecraft. 
[ ] PROJECT: Queekish
Being able to translate Queekish would be a boon for not just the Dwarves, but for all enemies of the Skaven.
[ ] PROJECT: Moulder Mysteries
Though they've been wiped from Eight Peaks, whatever it was Moulder was up to is certainly worrying. Chaos Dwarf anatomy? Druchii involvement? Perhaps this merits intensive investigation.
[ ] PROJECT: Burning Shadows
Weaponizing Karag Nar's shadow could add significantly to the security of the East Gate and the Citadel.
[ ] PROJECT: Undumgi
It's definitely not under the Court Wizard's umbrella, but Princess Edda is leaving money on the table by not involving herself in the Undumgi. A temporary intercession by yourself could set them up so they'd be able to function independently.
[ ] PROJECT: Cartographer
Your maps have made significant differences to several battles now. You could map the entirety of Karak Eight Peaks, and enchant a map room so that it would forever display your findings, and could be updated as needed.
[ ] PROJECT: Kvinn-Wyr
Kvinn-Wyr is a strategic boon, but it still needs to be retaken at some point. Perhaps a magical approach is the way to do so.
[ ] PROJECT: We
Though throwing different teachers at them until one sticks isn't the worst approach, perhaps you should give the matter your full and personal attention and get it done.
[ ] PROJECT: Defence
Though Clan Mors is unlikely to attack, Skaven are never entirely predictable and they might not remain your neighbours on all fronts. Magic might be able to amplify the underground defences, both your own and that of other Colleges.
[ ] PROJECT: Offence
With the Battle Wizards unleashed in Sylvania, they can't currently be sought for intervention in Eight Peaks.

- I've changed the 'Rune' and 'Enchantment' purchase votes to more general-purpose expenditures of Dwarf or College favour. These can also be made by write-ins in the turn votes, but not all would be associated with a single given action. The Collection of Important Information threadmark has a list of prices for either; if something isn't covered there, ask me. Keep in mind that most 'ask X to help with Y' plans can be covered by the Dwarven expert consultation or the College Journeyman/Magister/Lord Magister consultation scales.
- The 'keep him primarily' options for your captives will influence the options available when dealing with the captive; consider it a way to communicate to me, the writer, what your intentions are, should you be keeping him.
- There is a four hour voting moratorium. The Project vote and only the Project vote will be in Plan Format, as the number of suggestions is as important as the suggestions themselves. Remember to keep all votes you make in the same post.
- Keep in mind that while suggesting a project will let you dedicate your on-the-clock time to it and funnel the resources of the Karak into it, saving you money and Favour, it does mean that the rewards you might receive for it will be lessened, as part of the credit would go to King Belegar and Karak Eight Peaks.
- Projects are expected to take one year / two turns minimum, and taking longer than that will be alright if you can show tangible progress or give acceptable explanations for failure. If you've an idea for a Project, suggest it and I may add it to the list.
- This does look like a lot of things to throw at you at once, but the Elf/Skaven decisions have been fairly well discussed previously, the purchases are an established mechanic, and the Projects are pretty self-explanatory, so I'm hoping it works out.
