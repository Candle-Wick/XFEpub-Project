<br/>
The news is grim. There was not a mote of doubt in your mind or any other true Blood Raven's that committing to the total destruction of your Chaos-tainted brethren and Kyras himself was worth it. Even if the vast majority of the Chapter's relics have been destroyed or gone missing. Even if those who are left shall never be able to scrub the blood of those they called brother off of their hands fully. It could not possibly compare to the Horus Heresy, of course, but it was if the Blood Ravens were granted a vicious and heart rending experience of those dark days. To slay those they had fought alongside, shed blood alongside, lived and laughed alongside in those rare moments afforded to an Astartes.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you live, you shall never forget the crazed sneer on Isador's face as you ended him on Tartarus. And now, every living Blood Raven in Subsector Aurelia has their own Isador, their own Tartarus. You are sympathetic, but not paralyzed by it like some seem to be. The Scouts especially seem to be the worst affected, which is understandable given that they had yet to become full battle brothers. According to Sergeant Cyrus, Kyras had managed to recruit many of those aspirants at some unknown point. While the 10th Company's ship had survived the purge, its unblemished exterior did nothing to hint at the immense close-quarters carnage that had occurred within.<br/>
<br/>
So here you stand, in the hanger bays of your Chapter’s flagship, gazing out across the void towards the near-ruined bodies of your Chapter Fleet, where life barely flickers in their bodies. Rather like the Blood Ravens at the moment, you muse darkly. All have been towed into one general spot with the aid of the <i>Litany of Fury</i>, but you cannot stand upon the 3<span style="vertical-align:super">rd​</span> Company’s home as if it were your place forever now. The moment you became Chapter Master your place shifted here…such as the Battle Barge is.<br/>
<br/>
In the past month since the death of Kyras on Cyrene <i>everyone</i> has been called to work through the aftermath. Martellus and the serfs have been laboriously cataloguing what was lost over the course of the Third Aurelian Crusade, and while you knew the casualties would be significant you were not quite so sure of just how <i>many</i> would be lost. The relics, gone or destroyed or who knows what while the Chapter was under the malign influence of Chaos, and the <i>Gene-Seed</i>…the chambers on too many ships had been damaged in the fighting. The only other location potentially holding any was here on the ship itself, but Martellus had yet to try to make his way past the wary machine spirits of the venerable Battle Barge into the Implantation Chambers.<br/>
<br/>
Centuries with Kyras and the largely corrupt First Company…you can only hope to the God Emperor that it is not tainted further. That will require time under Martellus’s painstaking investigations.<br/>
<br/>
All is not lost, however. You still possess some Gene-Seed. Cyrus, acting as the Captain of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company in all practical aspects, has informed you of some scouts he believes would be capable of advancing to into full battle brothers. Far greater news than the fact that all aspirants and neophytes besides them are dead either due to Kyras or in the fighting to claim the flagship for the Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, however, your duties stretch forward in front of you. You must appoint…many things. Captains of Companies, new Masters of the Fleet, Apothecarion, and Recruits…as well as a new Chief Librarian. You find yourself in the incredible odd position of <i>not</i> having a large number of Librarians to choose from, a complete reversal of affairs for the Blood Ravens.<br/>
<br/>
Here, however, is where it shall all begin. From this humble hanger bay you can almost imagine you can see the whirlwind of combat going on below on Calderis, so chaotic is it that any recruiting measures there would be impossible. That you can see the largely unblemished – in comparison – Trontiux III an entire Subsector away. That you can see those of your Chapter who have disappeared towards the Ghoul Stars on a Mechanicus Explorator mission. Those of the Chapter in the Deathwatch. Even, perhaps, the troubling Aramus.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” Apollo calls behind you before sinking audibly to his knee, an action followed by those he has brought with him.<br/>
<br/>
You let loose a sigh tinged with pneumatics, and then gird yourself. You have no more time for doubts or regrets, not when the Blood Ravens need you strong. Then you turn, and face them. What remains of Aramus’s cohort, in Martellus, Cyrus, and Tarkus.<br/>
<br/>
“Let us begin, my brothers. Knowledge is power…” you intone solemnly.<br/>
<br/>
“…guard it well,” comes the response.<br/>
<br/>
"Let none find us wanting," all of you say at once.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Ravens <i>shall</i> rise again.<br/>
