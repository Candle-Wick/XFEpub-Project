    <h2>The Witch and her Hunter 1: Murder Most Foul</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Back cover blurb on a dog-eared copy of <i>The Witch and her Hunter 1: Murder Most Foul</i></b><br/>
<br/>
MAGDA WESSEN was a talented young apprentice in the shadowy GREY ORDER of WIZARDS. Until the FATEFUL DAY her kindly Magister was found RITUALLY MURDERED! Denounced as a WITCH and accused of a crime she didnâ€™t commit, Magda has no choice but to FLEE the Order. Ahead of her lies a long QUEST to prove her INNOCENCE and find the desperate CULTISTS she believes responsible for the heinous crime.<br/>
<br/>
ALBRECHT VON HAST is the WITCH HUNTER ordered to hunt Magda down. Tall, handsome, brave, from a noble line of Witch Hunters, will his PURSUIT bring them together? And if he does find Magda, will he believe her tale of innocence, or will he perform his SWORN DUTY to BURN THE WITCH?<br/>
<br/>
WORSE STILL, the ritual awakened some SHADOWY ENTITY from BEYOND that even now stalks Magda and those close to her. Will her PURE HEART and MAGIC be strong enough to save her, and those she cares about?<br/>
