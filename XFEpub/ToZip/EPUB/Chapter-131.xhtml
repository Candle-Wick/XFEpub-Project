    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 3 (12pm)</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Push further into Eshin territory and grab whatever you can while things are chaotic. (Probably Safe)



[Stealth: Intrigue, 35+22+5(Tactics: Skaven)=62.]

With Eshin so committed to their defence, there may never be a chance like this to try to steal some insight from the most secretive of Skaven Clans. Keeping a safe distance from the Eshin Sorcerer, you slip incorporeal through shadows and dart through the few light sources with bursts of invisibility, at one point using Smoke and Mirrors to jump from one side of a battlefield to another, using the Illusion it was built into to mask the faint puff of smoke that marks your relative lack of experience with the spell. It's not your best infiltration and you're certain it wouldn't suffice under normal circumstances, but while Eshin were sneaky, they usually aren't subtle, and you take your lack of sudden assault as a sign you've evaded notice.

[Loot finding: Intrigue, 82+22=104.]
[Rolling...]

If you had been able to spend weeks or months on the task as you had when raiding the other Clans, you'd know in advance where to go and what you'd expect to find. With mere minutes to spend before you need to turn around or risk the entire battle, you fall back on luck, guts, and wild guesses. The Eshin settlement seems much more orderly than that of Clan Mors, cleaner than Clan Moulder and less obviously riven by internal intrigue than Clan Skryre, but some things transcend Clan and you go straight for the largest structure you encounter, confident that it will belong to someone important. The room within is a bizarre clash between two rival styles, with one half of the room seeming to aspire to monkish asceticism while the other is a haphazard sprawl of books and paperwork not much different to that of human bureaucrats and officers you've seen. You empty the shelves that would be at eye-level for a Skaven, reasoning that they'd be the most often consulted ones, and pile atop those all the paperwork you can haphazardly stack atop each other. Your recent forays had led you to keeping a hessian bag folded up inside an inner pocket, and you spare the few seconds it takes to stack the books neatly inside it instead of piling them up haphazardly. Opening up the possibility of having an operation go badly because of bulky, difficult-to-carry loot is a rookie mistake.

---

Despite your still-lingering sense of unease about exfiltrations, you manage to get out as easily as you got in, and you make your way back to the Citadel with minutes to spare. In the handful of seconds you get before the Ranger reports start coming in, you skim through your loot. Your confidence in learning written Queekish takes a blow until you realize that the books aren't written in it. Cathayan, perhaps? You put them aside for later and skim instead through the paperwork, which turns out to be a series of updates from various corners of the world, detailing the hidden war within the Under-Empire. You burn with curiosity, but since none of it is immediately applicable, you're likewise forced to put it aside.

[Rolling...]

The bulk of the Rangers you dispatched went to Karagril, both to scout their defences and to check on the Underway to Karak Drazh. To your surprise, the greenskin pressure on under-Karagril hasn't stopped or even slowed - if anything it's increased, and all of Clan Mors' remaining forces, weapons and defences in the area are dedicated to holding that line. Just about any force could stroll right in and take it if they approached from any direction but from Karak Drazh, but you're not entirely sure you'd want to. On the other hand, the news from Kvinn-Wyr is a lot less straightforward. For reasons unknown, most of the trolls have deserted the peak, heading west towards Karag Mhonar and leaving only the river trolls in the vast cisterns and the ones twisted by warpstone exposure still jealously guarding their treasure near the peak. Having the option of repositioning the Kvinn-Wyr Wall bolt throwers is a definite plus, but you don't like having one more unknown factor at play in this chaotic mess of a battle.

Though there's a great many questions you'd prefer to answer before you start making moves, time is slipping away and so may be opportunity. And on top of that, forces can only remain ready for battle so long before they start getting restless. Clan Angrund itches to reconquer more of the Karak and King Kazador's many positive qualities do not include patience. And even if everyone does obey another order to sit and wait, they'll inevitably start to pay attention to the discomforts of armour and their grumbling bellies, and the eventual order to attack will find a force slightly less ready for war than if you hadn't waited.

- With the remaining Trolls isolated to the warpstone near the peak and the cisterns, a force could take most of the mountain without facing them and set up defensive positions against them. You can move the Kvinn-Wyr Bolt Throwers or any other siege weapons (except the ones facing Death Pass) to Kvinn-Wyr to hem in the trolls or to guard the approach from Karag Mhonar.
- There will be a four hour moratorium. Voting will be in plan format.
