+<i>To The End, Always+</i></b>​</div> <br/>
In the void, a storm raged. Over vast distances came spears of concentrated light, from technologies wholesome and alien, slamming into billowing shields or stabbing out into the darkness as the target danced unnaturally. Two arcing waves of scintillating light and eye shredding imagery soared through the darkness, lighting it with flickering holographic ghosts and false images. But in turn, red and black storm clouds, shot through with the gold and black of their allies, rushed forwards to meet them. In the center of these wrathful forces, cold and unflinching logic circuits faced off against searing inhuman outrage. Long range fire shot out amongst them all, lance arrays shrieking, pulsar lances gleaming, and smaller shoals of fighters spewing out of their metal or wraithbone hives. There would be no mercy, no surrenders, only the complete and total defeat of one side or the other – and the execution of the foe down to the last.<br/>

<br/>
Thunderous weaponry fired, spitting hot death in a dazzling array of varieties. Lance fire. Torpedoes. Bombardment cannons. Weapon arrays. All of these were tried and true methods, yet peppered throughout them all was the true danger, the true threat, for almost no vessel of the Angels of Death could match their foes within the void as equals. Not by tonnage, at least, but their weapons shot out in the darkness regardless. A great scattering of laser fire at close range scattered a wave of fighters, allowing thunderhawks to punch through, gunships firing to open the way for their transporting brethren. In other cases, under the daring orders of Captain Hadrian Priscus, the <i>Legacy of Polonius </i>used its lance array to sear apart a holofield array, shooting down boarding pods straight along the spine of an enemy ship.<br/>
<br/>
Things were less successful in the center, as the incredibly powerful Void Stalker battleships unleashed their horrifically powerful alien technologies. Pulsar lance bursts slammed against the ships of the Machine God, a concerted series of shots disabling outright a cruiser while the other ships near them assaulted the light cruisers and sent them listing. Even there, the Battle Barges of the Blood Ravens made their angry voices heard, firing weapons meant to bring entire planets to heel upon the foe, swiping aside holofields through psychic sight and firing out, only to find the sheer speed of the ships before them proving enough to keep most of them healthy and hale. Fighters fought as two competing ocean currents, and a hundred lives were lost in the opening seconds, hundreds more in the moments that followed.<br/>

<br/>
An explosive error, a psychometric fault, a lapse in concentration. Perhaps, even, the attentions of those who delighted in the death and destruction being unleashed so freely. Seers writhed as their attentions lapsed, the psychic power of the Librarius in this moment overwhelming them. Daemons clawed their way out of these alien psykers, falling upon crews, before themselves falling to bolter shell and chainsword. The few ships of the Mechanicus who had departed for this managed their own landing efforts, skitarii rampaging yet leaving as much of the delicate alien machinery intact as possible. Engines flared, and then died, while engines fell silent as their crews were brought low. Elsewhere matters were less successful, as without enough warning to do anything more than simply be aware of the cause, a Mechanicus cruiser died, a large salvo of pulsar lance bolts firing out of the Haven Spire reached them at extreme range. But by now, not that much range remained between the opposing fleets, turning the fight into an even deadlier dance.<br/>

<br/>
Destroyers and frigates alike found boarding pods and thunderhawks flying into them. At one point, having seen that more than one bridge was somewhat intact, Techmarine Calus decided that trying to find a breaching point was pointless. Especially when one was afforded to him. As such, the noble thunderhawk gunship that he piloted slammed forth into the ship’s small bridge, simultaneously killing every eldar on board while deploying the scouts and marines he had been transporting safely. Elsewhere, one Aconite which was simply too fierce found itself shot to pieces by the <i>Legacy of Polonius</i>, while a Hemlock – of which more than one had been captured before this battle had begun at all – was simply obliterated when the <i>Litany of Fury</i> shoved its bulk through the space the ship had happened to occupy. Though none saw Damion Tyrin’s bloodthirsty grin, none could fault his psychic guidance in that moment.<br/>
<br/>
The ships of the Basilikon Astra were not as numerous as the Imperial Navy. They had more than the resources, of course, and the facilities, but bound as they were by treaty could not spare the time. Without a doubt, they possessed many ships, however. And each of these was as blessed as could be by the adherents of the Omnissiah. Through the holy symbols and sacred oils, each facet, every screw and bolt, every handrail on the ships had been blessed through their construction. They showed that prowess then, ships thought dead by the enemy alighting once more as secondary logic engines chugged into life and reactors began to pump once more, marshalled by techpriests who had long since stopped needing base air and life support systems to function. Yet as transports soared into torn holes in enemy vessels, they found no easy prey. Dark Reapers with boots locked to the floors and ceilings let loose, ruining dozens of skitarii before they could even begin to board, while Blood Ravens found their beachhead positions assailed just as fiercely.<br/>

“Something is not right…,” Justinius growled from where he stood.<br/>
<br/>
Around him, strangely colored fires raged throughout the Void Stalker, mounds of fallen skitarii and slain eldar. Nearby, unbidden lightning and purpled tendrils with spikes whipped about from where a vortex grenade had opened a portal that had sustained itself. But he could not deal with it yet, struggling as he was against the psychic forces which clouded the entire battle. It was not like the veil, which had been masterfully crafted to work alongside searches, rather than block them entirely. Rather, this was a wall, and one that he had yet to break, nor any of the other Librarians involved in the fighting. The very fact that so much effort had been put forth into it alone was reason enough to be worried. Yet, before he could pierce the false futures and lying whispers which stymied his attempts to look beyond, he felt it. Knew it, in its coming, the faintest tinge of inhuman arrogance that marked the works of the eldar dead or alive. And the falling of a wall, the effort required to form it now available for use elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master, beware,” he called through the vox, casting a wave of lightning at a group of charging banshees, their screams turning from warcries to dying gurgles in an instant. “The eldar have done something!”<br/>
<br/>
Away from him, still on the bridge of the <i>Omnis</i>, in fact, Gabriel grit his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
“I am aware, brother. The Haven Spire spawns yet more of its defenders from within its depths.”<br/>
<br/>
Fully refueled, fully repaired, and in some few cases fully built, the Haven Spire opened secret and hidden passages within itself. From within, new eldar ships bounded into the fray as fast as their engines could carry them. Just as quickly as the formed, the passages closed, rotating sections of the Haven Spire disguised by advanced holofields, rapid movement, and even that most mundane of things – shutting their doors. Massive bulkheads of wraithbone and eldar alloy slammed shut, melding their form with the greater superstructure, removing weak points before they could be abused completely. So many more ships, flying into the fray against the Mechanicus and the ships of the Blood Ravens alike, and yet, there could be more. That they had hidden this well enough from auspex and the Librarians alike enraged Justinius.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Layered Veil: 31 vs. 24</b><br/>
<br/>
Significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Blood dripped from his eyes, but that could not stop the Chief Librarian. He grit his teeth, palm outstretched in the direction of the Haven Spire, even as more troops arrived, and then clenched his fingers. On the other end, he felt the sudden pinpricks of pain of his opposite, their surprise at the defiance leveled upon them. And in that moment, he struck further, his mind needing no respite for such an action, and tore open the film that had been stretched over his sight beyond sight. Then and there, he saw it, a ship still under construction yet. Bonesingers frantically sang their souls into the ship, while others rapidly began preliminary activation systems. A Shadow-class Cruiser, wholly intact, yet with none of its defensive systems in place just yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Divining Location: 42 vs. 27<br/>
</b><br/>
“I see you now,” Justinius sneered, uncaring of the waves of fire being directed around him, of a Blood Raven carrying a heavy bolter firing into a group of guardians right next to him. “<i>I see you now!</i>”<br/>
<br/>
And so he did. A Farseer, safe not on her vessel as he had at first suspected, but upon the Haven Spire itself. Why she was there, what she was doing beyond what he had just ceased, he could not see. But for the moment, he did not need to. She was deeper within the Haven Spire, deep enough that he could not pinpoint her exact location, only its general placement. But that was not what focused his attention. The whole of this endeavor came from the infamous Argante Station’s example, a remarkably intact Shadow-class Cruiser. And there, one lay, as yet still in the womb, complete yet not awake. A prize indeed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A resurgence, perhaps out of desperation, and enormous chunks of hull were turned to slag, boiling the serfs and servitors within. Damage taken over time proved too much, and the Gladius <i>Vidya’s Venom</i> finally broke completely. Its few serf crew screamed as they were cast into the void, those that had lived through the repeated bombardments and torpedo strikes, and to their good fortune they all died quickly. Elsewhere, within those same ships which had brought such death, the Blood Ravens bellowed their own roars and brought low many an alien pilot and gunner. Meanwhile, in the center of the entire battle, the eldar ships new and old danced, yet that alone could not avail them against the ships of the Omnissiah’s chosen. Advanced shielding and improved weaponry ensured that there was no true advantage that could not be equaled, though not surpassed. At the least, until more and more Blood Ravens and skitarii forced their way into the enemy ships, one Eclipse-class finally forced to direct all its attentions inwards. It’s very hangars had been turned into invasion points, its fighter compliments running out of fuel and ammo bereft of resupply.<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel watched all of this from the bridge of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>, and knew that a decision would have to be made. Part of him might even have winced in sympathy as another great pulsar lance salvo shot out from the Haven Spire to actually destroy the engines of one of the Basilikon battleships, though not the Emperor-class upon which their Archmagos ally was leading from. That would have to be dealt with, as soon as possible. And while the Haven Spire was not, in fact, a planet, it was large indeed and possessed deathly weaponry. Not even their ally’s ships were built for such an assault. But the Blood Ravens were. A series of paths, each fraught with their own risks.<br/>
<br/>
It was then that the command channel, reserved for only those with the highest possible access, activated with multiple voices at once.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master, I have located the Corsair Prince who leads this band of xeno scum,” came the call of his Chief Librarian, ever striving to make up for even the slightest perceived failure. “He is on this vessel, the Void Stalker from before!”<br/>
<br/>
“With your leave, Chapter Master,” Apollo said, and Gabriel glanced at the disgraced yet legendary Diomedes from where he knelt, weapon held out in front of him. “I would deploy by teleportarium, and slay this Corsair Prince personally.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ship tallies coming in, Angelos,” Hadrian’s snarl erupted. “We have lost some escorts, but have captured enemy vessels in kind. Some of our cruisers are damaged, but the Battle Barges remain stalwart!”<br/>
<br/>
“We have taken casualties, Chapter Master,” Gracchus called out from within the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>, the whine of his equipment mid-operation audible even then. “Some may require internment within a dreadnought shell, others can be salvaged entirely, others…cannot. It remains to be seen.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><b>Decisions For Phase 4</b>​</div> <br/>
The Corsair Prince of this band must be slain, for his crimes now and past, against humanity and the universe for existing. He has been located on one of the Void Stalker battleships, which is currently under a more than appreciable amount of boarder assault. Justinius is currently present, and Apollo wishes to deploy. No doubt he holds some of his greatest warriors, but so too are the Blood Ravens present, alongside Mechanicus boarding teams. Up to and including deadly Myrmidon teams amongst the skitarii.<br/>
<br/>
[] Allow Apollo: Let one of the greatest warriors the Blood Ravens possess challenge this alien champion. He will have support, not just from Blood Ravens but from the Mechanicus forces as well.<br/>
[] Disallow Apollo: He is required him elsewhere, do not deploy him for this.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The Haven Spire holds in its berths a silent yet complete Shadow-class Cruiser, the enemy Farseer, and is itself a bastion of alien activity. It has provided a home for these Corsairs for too long! Yet, to throw brothers and ships carelessly would be more than dangerous. Is the prize of a fully intact ship worth it? Perhaps, perhaps not. On the other hand, battle brothers are currently occupied with boarding operations across the rest of the eldar fleet, including the Void Stalker battleships, and the currently present Shadow-class and Eclipse-class vessels. Focus the Blood Ravens upon these, and while they may not be pristine, quantity has a quality all its own. It would certainly be less dangerous than throwing the fleets towards the Haven Spire without support from the still embattled Mechanicus. And yet…a Farseer, and whatever else might lie within the Haven Spire?<br/>
<br/>
[] Focus On Current Boarding: The eldar haven’t yet managed to destroy the ships that are being captured, but that might yet change. Plus, there is a bounty of vessels that need to be fully captured. Two battleships, cruisers, and escort vessels alike. Take these down fully, and the Mechanicus could focus fully upon the Haven Spire! [Write-In Priority Of Vessels For Boarding Teams]<br/>
[] Forge Ahead: You can pull your brothers out from ships that are already captured, and lessen your presence on other vessels. Charge forth, letting the Battle Barges lead, and deploy directly onto and into the Haven Spire itself. Let the bombardment cannons tear holes that not even holofields can deflect or disguise. Take the Shadow-class Cruiser, and hunt the Farseer down. Slaughter the xenos entirely!
