The most disturbing thing about passing through the safe passages of the gravity reefs was that visually there was nothing wrong whatsoever, at first. Though the shutters would slam closed in the event of warp travel, in moments such as this they were open, revealing to all on the bridge of the <i>Litany of Fury</i> the void outside and all its twinkling stars. But then, if one looked closely, they could actually see how some of the stars were smeared, the photons, the very light that was broadcast from all directions was bent and twisted by the forces of gravity. Some stars looked like streaks, while others were actual glowing lines that bent in and over themselves in strange loops. Worse than that, was when Apollo particularly squinted he could see scraps of bent and stressed metal here and there. Bulkheads, perhaps, or maybe just the last remnants of entire ships that had been shredded so thoroughly as to leave nothing behind but a few square feet of adamantium.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when he ordered the sensors to scan, he found that he was right. A few patches of metal, perhaps some tubing, things that were so infinitesimally small that if they hadn’t had an entire week of sub-light travel to get though the gravity reef the advanced sensors of the battle barge wouldn’t even have caught them. Some of them were of material makes that he recognized, alloys that the sensors could categorize, but the same was not true for all of them. They were invisible to the naked eye at the distances in which they hung, suspended, the fractional remains of an unknowable amount of vessels and celestial bodies that had run into the gravity reef and were rent asunder. He could look, in the distance, to where the supposed solar system they were targeting was, and he would see that increasingly less distant star bent out into a lightning bolt at one point and then disappear entirely in another – the light that exuded from it bent so completely by the gravity reef that it was dissipated wholly before reaching them.<br/>
<br/>
Looking with the actual sensors was far more horrifying, to see the sheer strength of the gravity reef expressed in cold numbers. To know that to twitch the battle barge out of the right alignment, that should the navigators and astropaths and librarians grow distracted for a single second, that the <i>Litany of Fury</i> could be ripped to pieces without warning? He’d run the calculations, and should more than a sixth of the ship touch the gravity reef, the sheer unrelenting force of it would drag the rest of the battle barge into the gravity reef to be pulped and torn. It would not matter, ship, dreadnought, or space marine, all would suffer the same immediate fate. The same would be true for any of the other ships with them, at varying but consistently low percentages of failure required before it became fatal for anyone aboard the vessel in question.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of…<br/>
<br/>
“Send a course correction to Fireship Primus and Secundus, they’re drifting too close to the walls of the tunnel again,” Gabriel barked from the command throne. “Quickly, now!”<br/>
<br/>
Surely, if the Mechanicus had more time, they would have provided more easily directed vessels. Perhaps with the ability to use the teleportarium to evacuate the bridge crew, if nothing else. But they had not been able to spare anything more than what they have – which was, admittedly, no small contribution – as almost all of the Mechanicus in three sectors was focusing on the recently lost Forge World. However, he’d grown rapidly exasperated with the fire ships and their servitor crews. Slow to respond at the best of times, it was a matter of constant flight path adjustment as the tunnel ever so slightly drifted and fluctuated as they passed through it.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that made the achingly slow progress bearable was the fact that sensors couldn’t penetrate the gravity reef from within or without. Perhaps sorcerous scrying might provide an insight into their oncoming assault, but the Librarius had been constantly working to keep up as best a warding as they could against such things. Of course, the presence of a ward might, alone, be a sign, or at least that was as far as Apollo had gotten in speaking his thoughts before Justinius had turned on him and started an impromptu three-hour long lecture about varieties and intricacies of warding efforts. One of the most pertinent of which was the warding that both hid what it was hiding as well as hiding itself in the first place. The appearance of nothing instead of an opaque barrier. At the same time, it was hard to know for certain if said warding had been successful until they’d reached the target.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Warding: 86<br/>
<br/>
Sorcerous Scrying: 20</b><br/>
<br/>
That Apollo could summarize it so and the Chief Librarian had somehow stretched it into three hours had thoroughly convinced the disgraced champion that it had been on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
But that didn’t matter, in the end.<br/>
<br/>
What mattered was that Apollo was that much closer to excising more of the poisonous history of the Blood Ravens, of the Black Legion, and of the machinations of Kyras. For so many centuries, he had been blind to it all. How much might have been changed, how many brothers might he have saved, were he not blinded by his arrogance? Would he have noticed that House Vandis had fallen to Chaos long ago, during one of those many meetings that he’d had with them, diplomacy between Kyras and their House enacted with him as the unknowingly damned messenger? Though the Ordo Hereticus had scoured the spires of Meridian, some of the houses had fallen or been lost during the fighting. How many had fled into the arms of the Black Legion rather than into the Emperor’s? Perhaps, now, of all times, he would know.<br/>
<br/>
The minute their target had been confirmed, they had turned to the archives once more, and Apollo as well. House Vandis had ruled for millennia, their leadership installed by the writ of the High Lords of Terra themselves. Arrogant, as all mortal nobles were, stewards of Angel Forge. The current Patriarch of their misbegotten House was Marcus Vandis, and yet Apollo had met with his father Damon Vandis as well, all on the orders of Kyras. They had no idea how long this system had been under their control, nor how long they had been heretics and traitors, let alone if the two had occurred at separate or the same times. Too many unknowns, brought about by his foolishness. But perhaps, <i>perhaps</i>, this would be his redemption, or at least a single step upon that long and arduous road.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master, we are coming up on the end of the gravity reef passage,” a serf said aloud. “Your orders?”<br/>
<br/>
Apollo glanced up to where Gabriel sat, not even yet clad in his terminator armor. Instead, the Chapter Master sat upon the command throne like a king of old, chin propped atop a clenched fist with elbow against the throne’s armrests. His eyes glared ahead, as if to pierce though the gravity reef entirely into the system they were about to enter. Bounced sensor returns were already returning ghost signals and wave forms, potential worlds and ships that could not be confirmed until they truly reached the terminus point.<br/>
<br/>
“Forward,” Gabriel said firmly. “Set fire ships Primus and Secundus ahead, seek and destroy assault patterns, against any targets their sensors detect the second the exit the tunnel. The same for the two behind them.”<br/>
<br/>
“Aye, Chapter Master,” the serf nodded as the punched in the correct command codes and transmitted them across the void.<br/>
<br/>
Apollo felt his two hearts beating faster and faster, the tension mounting across the bridge as the got ever closer. Ahead of the <i>Litany of Fury</i>, the fire ships accelerated just a bit, though he could only see such upon the actuality sphere. Forward, forward, and then all of a sudden all of the sensor returns started to stabilize, the actuality sphere buzzing slightly as all of the new information came in and was displayed towards the end of the tunnel. The battle barge itself was coming in at a vertical downwards angle, but the tunnel itself straightened out just at the end into a horizontal terminus directly forward. Even here, even now, the gravity reefs strained the sensors terribly.<br/>
<br/>
“Possible confirmed defensive stations and minefield!” One of the serfs cried in alarm. “Fire ships confirm signal code request from – the enemy is firing!”<br/>
<br/>
All watched the emotionless servitor crews set the fire ships to accelerate to top speed, burning their fuel in overdrive that would strain their engines to breaking – if only they were expected to survive the fight. In return, the telltale signs of macro cannon fire and lance arrays blinked into being on the actuality sphere as it projected the combat as best as it could. There were even a quartet of torpedoes thrown in for good measure.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Vandis Defenses: 63<br/>
Two Fire Ships: 12</b><br/>
<br/>
The fire ships detonated as they were torn apart, payloads erupting in bright fire that was so powerful in its explosive force as to momentarily blind the sensors of the battle barge, to the point that the actuality sphere’s projections returned zero sums for a moment before functionality returned. But all that was truly needed were the holographic sigils denoting a total loss of contact and presumed ship loss for the former position of the two fire ships. Expended wholly, without actually striking anything at all. At the very least, their sacrifice had provided some small amount of intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
“Forward!” Gabriel cried, standing up from the throne and gesturing. “Signal the fleet, prepare for battle! The enemy is there, waiting, and we have come for them!”<br/>
<br/>
Just up ahead, and far closer to the Omnis, were the second two fire ships, and now they too accelerated out of the gravity reef.<br/>
<br/>
“Fire ship sensors confirm defense stations, unknown classification! Torpedo launchers, defense lasers, macro cannons! Fire ships are accelerating!”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Vandis Defenses: 43<br/>
2 Fire Ships: 68</b><br/>
<br/>
This time the fire ships, their engines pushed as hard as possible beyond safety limits, struck something. It was impossible to know exactly just what, considering the nature of the tunnel and the gravity reef, but the sensors returned enormous explosions beyond just the natural result of a fire ship’s destruction. Then the <i>Litany of Fury </i>burst free into the system, hull still licked slightly by the burning flames that were rapidly exhausting themselves in the void into nothingness. A number of defense stations that had likely been towed to the area were destroyed, at least six but possibly more. However, the same second that Apollo processed that, the sensors picked up everything else.<br/>
<br/>
“Enemy ship contacts, there are more defense stations – one is firing!”<br/>
<br/>
An incredibly powerful laser struck the <i>Battle Barge</i> head on, the single beam slamming hard into the void shields, hard enough that it shook the frame of the battle barge. The station that it had come from was bent and twisted, the odious influence of the powers of Chaos clearly affecting it. The same was true for the other defense stations, both those still functioning and those that had clearly been ruined. Also amongst the wreckage was what might have been a light cruisers and a handful of escorts. But there was yet more.<br/>
<br/>
“Standard yellow sun, five planets – the development implies long-term settlement and build-up!” One serf cried frantically.<br/>
<br/>
“Enemy ships turning about, five enemy defense stations still operational, two are capital killers!”<br/>
<br/>
“Target those first, then prepare for the enemy ships’ arrival!” Gabriel ordered, “Send orders back to the fleet, spread out upon exiting the gravity reef!”<br/>
<br/>
Ahead, Apollo stared grimly at the actuality sphere, the sensors now far more capable of sensing what was about them. There were a number of enemy ships projected there, all of them tainted by Chaos. Some were clearly former Imperial Navy; others had perhaps been constructed in the hell-furnaces of the Dark Mechanicus wholesale. Cruisers, grand cruisers, and escort vessels. At the head of them all was one of the most horrifying sights possible: a battle barge. The once glorious vessel of the Imperium had become disgraced and disgusting. The symbols of Chaos had been engraved across its body, the emblems of the Imperium desecrated and replaced with the foul sigils of the Dark Gods. A fell and clearly infernal light burned in its body, as molten liquids almost like the droll of a beast slipped from the barrels of its guns.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the vox opened as a broadcast on all channels began.<br/>
<br/>
“<b>AHAH…AHAHAH...AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA</b>!”<br/>
<br/>
Without word, without declaration or order, the ships of the Chaos fleet advanced, firing their weapons with reckless abandon at the battle barges that had presented themselves. Behind them had come the strike cruisers and their escorts, and behind the Imperial Navy. Lances and bombardment cannons fired at the longest distance, while macro cannons and other shorter range weaponry tore apart the remaining defense stations quickly before they could prove much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“BLOOOOOOD RAAAAAAVENS?! FOR TOO LONG, I HAVE BEEN KEPT HERE, LEASHED BY THE DESPOILER’S WILL, BEGGING FOR A TRUE CHALLENGE, A WORTHY FOE! BUT INSTEAD, THEY MOCK ME, AND SEND BLOOOOOOD RAAAAAAAVEEEENS!?”</b><br/>
<br/>
The ships got closer and closer, the first clouds of fighters and bombers pouring outwards in great deluges to meet in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“HAHAHAHAH!!!!”</b> The voice went on in another burst of mad laughter before settling, ever so slightly, the voice still tinged clearly by insanity.<b> “Come then, Blood Ravens! Come, and taste the blades of the Black Legion once more, and be found wanting before the Corpse-Emperor as your kind ever have! I am Mortirex, Lord of the Black Legion, the Great Desecrator, and I will be your end! After all, you might provide a <i>bit </i>of sport, mewling children that you are if you managed to slay Araghast!”</b><br/>
<br/>
“Call…call confirmed…,” the serf at the vox stations stammered out, sweating heavily and shivering with fear. “Origin is the enemy battle barge, identi-identif-gah!” The serf cried aloud, shielding their eyes as the infernal text attempted to quite literally burn his retinas and soul at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
“Beware!” Justinius cried, his hands casting out a soothing blue light across the serf’s body, “The enemy sends memetic hazards through their broadcasts! Limit data consumption through secondary intake methods, read them not with your own eyes!”<br/>
<br/>
<b>“Then again, perhaps not! It seems Araghast was more successsful than I thought, if this is all your Chapter could possibly muster. But fear not, Blood Ravens! Your souls shall find worth in sacrifice to the Dark Gods, if nothing else!”</b><br/>
<br/>
The ships of the Imperial Navy maneuvered to join the fight properly, coming up and under the Blood Ravens with full salvoes.. Vox signals from the Imperial Navy were already ordering the troop transports to back up, to remain within the comparative safety of the tunnel, lest they become lambs to the slaughter. Unfortunately, this also meant that the Inquisitor's ship and its guns could not contribute to the fight, nor could the fire ships behind them all. The tight confines of the tunnel meant that unless the troop transports willingly exposed themselves to the enemy, neither the Vengeance-class Grand Cruiser nor the fire ships would be capable of contributing to the fight at all.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the vox opened and new voice spoke. Sibilant and haughty all at once.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, well. Blood Ravens. What a...delight, to see you all again," Governor Marcus Vandis said. "It has been so long."<br/>
<br/>
Apollo clenched his fist around the haft of his power mace and exhaled slowly through grit teeth.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems the rumors were true. Your fortunes truly have fallen so very low," he chuckled as if at one of those blasted dinner parties held in the spires of Meridian. "But that does make you even more valuable as potential parts of my new collection."<br/>
<br/>
The vox systems squealed once more.<br/>
<br/>
"<b>Ggrrangh, Vandis! This is my battle!</b>" Mortirex snarled. <b>"Posture and wheedle elsewhere-,"</b><br/>
<br/>
"You serve <i>me!"</i> Vandis half-sneered, half-shouted. "By my pact with the Black Legion and the Despoiler, you are <i>my servant, </i>Mortirex! Now then, bring me their relics, it shall be a fitting replacement for what they stole from my warehouses!"<br/>
<br/>
"Y<b>our arrogance will be your undoing, mortal..</b>.," Mortirex snapped. "<b>We shall see if their mongrel hides are worth anything in your precious collection once I have TORN THEM ASUNDER!"</b><br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master!” Came the cry from across the Blood Raven fleet, all of them asking what to do.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Entry Into System 384A Achieved! Enemy Defenses Included Powerful Defense Platforms, Defensive Fleet! 4 Fire Ships Lost! Naval combat immediately initiates as Chaos Fleet advances! Troop transports remaining in gravity reef tunnel! Chaos Lord of the Black Legion identified as commanding enemy fleet, Lord Mortirex! System 384A Contains 5 Worlds, Currently Unidentified and Unclassified. Combat has immediately initiated, zero chance to reverse or retreat without clogging into troop transports, turning about/reversing within tunnels impossible for ships larger than cruiser tonnage. Imperial Navy+Adrastia focusing on keeping the enemy at range and are trying to take out as many escorts and boarding craft as possible. Other fire is being directed towards the enemy cruisers. </b><br/>
<br/>
<u>Chapter Master, What Are Your Orders For Our Ships?</u><br/>
<i>GM NOTE: 12 Hour Voting Moratorium</i><br/>
<br/>
[] Remain At Range: The Imperial Navy is not built nearly as durably as your own ships, and though you have far fewer you could willingly use the ships of the Blood Ravens to screen and protect them as much as possible as they play out their long range duels against the Black Legion vessels. You are outnumbered, and notably so. This is familiar territory, but this fleet has apparently grown bored and reckless without 'entertainment', and are rushing headlong into the the Imperium's guns.<br/>
[] Close In: Codex-standard tactics for space marine is to board enemy vessels to disable their systems or destroy them, relying on the durability of their ships to protect them. You may not have the entire Chapter with you, but the battle brothers you have will have to be enough. Break the enemy shields, board, destroy as many vital systems as possible, and move on. Dangerous, incredibly so, and a tactic that would surely be impossible at the pace required for victory were it not performed by space marines.<br/>
