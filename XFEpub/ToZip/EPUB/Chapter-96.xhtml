Derillion might be personally upset, but the greater Mechanicus cannot possibly be anything but grateful for what you have gained for them this day. The battle is over, now is the time to regroup and resupply. (Operation Ends, No More Losses/Injury Chances, Move On To End Point)</div>

+<i>To The End, Always+</i></b><br/>​</div>In the end, Gabriel refused to sacrifice more of his brothers in this. More than enough of a bounty had been claimed including a ship which was just as valued as for the original Argante Station incident in the first place. A Shadow-class cruiser, without any alien crew or sabotage, ready for towing back towards the Forgeworld. Along with all of the other ships. Now was time to gather up the lost, gather what gene-seed that could be retrieved, and return to their ships. Archmagos Derillion was less than pleased with the decision but in the end, he too was forced to begin pulling his forces back. Even in this, treachery against her own kind, the Farseer ‘Mestela’ had planned. There were simply too many scuttling charges, too many sabotages of internal systems, and the Haven Spire was falling apart as they spoke.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of skitarii were lost in the pulling back, Derillion ranting about the damned xenos, seething as he began to tow his ships back together. Weeks passed in the void as the techmarines and techpriests alike did their best to fix the damages sustained, but it was not nearly as needed as it might have been. For a secret signal in binary, paired with the power of the <i>Sanctorium Arcanum</i> and the Librarius of the Blood Ravens, was enough to pull forth more ships of the Adeptus Mechanicus. With their aid, forge ships and servitors aplenty, every ship that the Basilikon Astra had lost was revived or taken for repairs. Only the skills of the techpriests could do such, and yet it was done regardless. With the <i>Litany of Fury</i> leading the way, the concentrated power of the Blood Raven Librarius powering it, they returned through the warp and once more basked in the light of the distant Astronomican.<br/>
<br/>
But they could not cease there.<br/>
<br/>
For the first time in many years, the Blood Ravens appeared in Sector Krasus, the heart of the entire Sector Korianis. Every possible ship that could be used in guarding the captured bounty was practically demanded by the wishes of the Mechanicus. The series of queries and hails from across the system, and the subsequent reactions to their responses, only affirmed to Gabriel how little trusted the Blood Ravens remained. Especially here. For here did Battlefleet Korianis make its home, and they were more than a little leery of the Chapter, the same for Sector Command. Yet here they were, reaching the venerable shipyards of Forgeworld Zerann 52X1. And here, like in the past, was a greeting vessel of great power and strength over the shipyards. Phokas, Fabricator-General of Zerann, came personally to greet his allies. Little emotion could be discerned from his metallic frame, but there were visible shudders here and there. A mechadendrite shifting and twitching for no discernible purpose. In the distance, a mass which simply demanded attention, hung within its own individualized shipyard, built half-way around it. What was once the space hulk <i>Judgement of Carrion </i>was almost unrecognizable save for its size. Split open at the seams, it was obvious that multiple ships had been extracted from within its insides, while a strong core remained to be built. When that was done, Gabriel surmised that it could be almost twice the size of a standard Imperial battleship.<br/>
<br/>
"Chapter Master," he bowed his head slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Fabricator-General," Gabriel nodded back.<br/>
<br/>
"You have done...well. Very well, in fact. You have acquired that which originally began the Argante Station incident in the first place, alongside a bounty of other vessels," Phokas stated steadily, his voice flickering here and there. "Now, in joining with the Imperial Navy, we shall finally rip the secrets free denied to us after the Gothic War. Our foundries...," he gestures behind him towards the planet which slowly rotates below, "Are open to you."<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Gabriel shut his organic eye, carefully controlling the relief which desired to express itself through him. A victory, yes hard fought, and not without casualties. But now, a chance, to finally restore the fleet of the Blood Ravens in no small measure. Perhaps not wholly, but that was unlikely even after a single event. They had not struck down a Craftworld after all. Then the moment passed, and he opened his eye again to take the dataslate offered to him by the techpriest. Data and tallies fluttered up and down its frame, before finally ending on a remarkably stark set of lines.<br/>
<br/>
"Further," Phokas said quietly, "If you would consider committing some of your ships to safeguarding this place - for we know well that there can be no true certainty when it comes to eldar trickery - we would be further grateful."<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel inhaled sharply.<br/>
<br/>
"But a single company fleet could vastly increase our ability to resist any eldar reprisal," Phokas said steadily, "You know this."<br/>
<br/>
"There are other matters within the sector that demands our attention, and beyond, Phokas," Gabriel shook his head. "You know that."<br/>
<br/>
The techpriest cocked his head, nodding slowly.<br/>
<br/>
"This is true. Consider the matter, that is all I ask. Rest assured, what you have done already is considerable indeed."<br/>

<b>Note: All damages sustained by the Blood Raven ships is assumed to be desired for fixing. As such, the lowest tiers of ship captures are going towards this. The remainder of potential ship gains is below. Because of the varied conditions of the ships, different numbers, and owner differences, the shipyards have instead come up with these options instead of trying to badger over each individual worth of the ships, in terms of favors or otherwise. There is yet a write-in option, however, if you wish to do so.</b><br/>
