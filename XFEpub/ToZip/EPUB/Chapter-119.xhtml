What you've taken to thinking of as your White Tower after its limestone exterior was entirely the creation of Dwarves, but though Dwarves supply the stone and the muscle, the design of your Grey Tower is entirely the work of the Grey College. Algard supplies the fundamentals, having researched the matter thoroughly in the creation of his own towers, and to build on that you are forced to subject yourself to the Celestials.

The College itself stands surprisingly close to the Imperial Palace and the Great Temple of Sigmar, but nobody notices it, protected as it is by an enormously overdone enchantment. The insistent mental suggestion that what you're seeking lies in any other direction bounces off a mind trained to wrestle with ambiguities and misdirection, and the magic gets more and more agitated as it realizes that you're not being dissuaded from looking directly at the sixteen slender towers it protects, and it starts tweaking fate more and more to try to obstruct you. A couple have a screaming argument right in front of you, which you ignore. A cart has a wheel fall off in just the right place, until you take three steps to the left. A sudden mist materializes, doing nothing to block your Magesight. A painter carrying a precariously large bucket of whitewash totters towards you, until your glare overrides the set of coincidences that had set him on a collision course with you and he carefully avoids you, and inadvertently avoids the loose cobble that had been firmly attached to the ground a moment ago. Finally, the bottom-left quarter of the square black door swings open and a peeved doorkeeper bustles over to ask your business before the enchantment starts getting drastic. You make no attempt to hide your pleased smirk, knowing the doorkeeper would have been just as smug if you had actually approached the door and triggered the prognostication charms that would have told him your business in advance.

Within the cobbled courtyard of the Celestial College you're no less disruptive to their little games, and with a mental exercise you were taught when you were eleven you hold firmly in your mind the thought that you have no idea where you're going, and just as a Perpetual appears around a corner with an arched eyebrow and directions on his tongue, you sweep right past him and continue on your way. Hubert had been quite informative, knowing better than to side against his dear teacher, and following his directions you make your way to the quarters of Magister Kereveld, who had sparred with young Hubert during his apprenticeship and seemed to have his head screwed on straighter than most. According to apprentice rumour, he had disdained using the stars to tell the future and instead used them to tell true north, and signed on to a flotilla to Lustria to seek his fortune. He instead found a continent filled with unfriendly reptiles, and after tearing a star from the sky to bludgeon a sea serpent and coming off second-best in a magical duel with some sort of magical frog, he had turned right back around, returned to Altdorf, and resolved never to leave his home continent again.

You find the wizard right where Hubert told you he would be, and you allow him the satisfaction of having expected your arrival and you allow him the customary fifteen minutes to talk your ear off about his topic of choice, which turns out to be the debated existence of a tenth planet, and how calculus factors into the debate. Due to reading you did to properly describe the Matrix, you find yourself surprisingly able to follow his argument, and being able to engage with the topic dear to his heart instead of merely smiling and nodding earns you enough goodwill that when his time is over, he does not hesitate to turn over control of the discussion. Just as you'd hoped, Kereveld is practical enough to understand weather in general, not just weather as it pertains to his magic, and with an unspoken exchange of the ephemeral currency of the Colleges, he's able to sketch out the basics of how to attract a certain type of weather without involving or attracting Azyr, the wind of magic most closely attuned to weather in general.

With a list of helpful titles in hand, you make your way to the least protected of the Celestial College's libraries, which by an agreement almost as old as the Colleges would lend out its works to Magisters in good standing of any College. You find the titles in question, then stare at them intently thinking surreptitious thoughts; two servants and an apprentice all collide at the doorway as the magics of the Celestial College hastily tries to throw a coincidence in the path of your imagined plans, and you smirk your way past the three of them with the books you have every right to borrow in hand. With a little time, a lot of mathematics, no small amount of expensive materials, a few beams of wood imported from Araby, and a failed power stone that only attracts instead of emitting Ulgu, your tower takes shape. Every morning when the sun rises above the mountains, instead of burning away in its merciless light, the morning mist flees to your Grey Tower to be absorbed; since the absorption is metaphorical rather than literal, this leaves a great deal of condensation and the ever-practical Dwarves rig up gutters and tubing to collect it, and you're now able to start each morning with a refreshing drink of morning dew.

Though a pair of under-robe shoulder holsters had some popularity amongst the Grey College, ever since you began learning the greatsword you've favoured practical snug tailoring secured with belts instead of the loose and billowy robes that would allow easy access to a hidden arsenal, though your accurate and conveniently slim Marksdwarf's pistol does find a home within an inner pocket. Some pistoliers favour a one-on-each-hip arrangement of holsters, while those that fight with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other prefer both pistols on one side, as only their off-hand would need access to them. That Branulhune takes only a thought to draw clinches the argument in favour of the former, as you could unload a revolver with your dominant hand and then summon Branulhune to it and draw the second revolver with your offhand during combat, and the overall effect is pleasingly symmetrical.

While you're considering your growing collection of belts, holsters and scabbards, you finally give in to practicality and remove the back scabbard that you've worn for about a decade and entrust Branulhune to the Rune of the Unknown. With a revolver on each hip you're no less visibly armed, and an enemy that doesn't know you've a greatsword on hand is that much more easily dispatched. And you don't have to worry about getting it caught while clambering into gyrocopter seats.

Speaking of which...

---

Your Mockery of Death could hold for at least a week, so the two days it will take for him to be transported to Altdorf is no trouble at all, and you can't help but smile at the idea of the Naggarothi Elf being punched out in Clan Moulder's territory and coming to in the custody of his Ulthuani kin. You sling him into the gyrocarriage and set off once more, having grown accustomed enough to gyrocopter travel that you're able to concentrate on your reading while en route.

You've walked past the Ulthuan Embassy a time or two in the past. Built for Teclis, Yrtle and Finreir to call home during the Great War Against Chaos, it was built in an attempt to ape the style of Lothern by architects that had never been further than Marienburg, which so amused and delighted Teclis that he wove sorcery into it that has resisted the attempts of every Ulthuani ambassador since to tear it down. The Ten Kingdoms of Ulthuan are, while united, possibly even touchier about how independent they may or may not be from the Phoenix King than Elector Counts are about the Emperor, and the Ambassadorship rotates on a regular basis based on whichever Kingdom needs their ego soothed. Currently it flies the flag of the moonlit raven, the flag of Nagarythe, the haunted land ravaged once by daemons and ever since by strife. Malekith was once Prince of Nagarythe, and when his civil war to seize the Phoenix Crown failed, he didn't just take his people with him, he tore the fortress-cities of Nagarythe from the isle of Ulthuan and sailed them to the land that would become known as Naggaroth. Those Nagarythians more loyal to the Phoenix King of Ulthuan than the Prince of Nagarythe inherited a half-drowned, half-ruined land of ghosts and blood and ashes, and ever since have sworn vengeance upon their treacherous kin. You almost feel bad for your captive.

To be a Grey Magister is to be in the service of the Empire, whatever else you might be doing, and that gets you in the door. Your cargo, carried in a wheelbarrow you borrowed from a cabbage merchant, gets you a meeting with the Ambassador himself, who introduces himself only as Daroir. He is dressed in the colourful silks of a typical Elven politician, but protrusions and the clinks when he moves indicates it is worn over armour and probably weapons. He offers you refreshments in stilted but otherwise perfect Reikspiel, and though he has the manner of a politician, the actions are robotic and his gaze never strays far from the face of your cargo. "Tell us," he asks as he sips daintily from a crystal glass, "how one of our shameful brothers has entered into your captivity."

Under other circumstances you might be more circuitous, but to Nagarythe, there is only one historical enemy of Ulthuan that matters. "The Karaz Ankor is reclaiming Karak Eight Peaks, and have recently wiped out Clan Moulder's presence underneath it. This Naggarothi was their guest."

"I trust," he says after some thought, "that in saying that, you are not using a humorous inaccuracy when you mean he was enslaved by them."

"He was found unrestrained in comfortable quarters, with silken sheets and valuable trophies and  Lustrian gold. I do not know why he was there, but it was some sort of partnership between Skaven and Druchii."

"He has not been questioned?" Only an acceleration in his emotionless words indicates his anticipation.

"He has not been allowed to regain consciousness since he was captured. When he is awoken, no time for him will have passed since he was in the Moulder warren."

"A generous gift, from an unexpected quarter." Daroir smiles in anticipation. "It is a rare gambit of Teclis that does not bear fruit. I am glad to see the blossoming of this flower." He lifts a hand to his long, snow-white hair, and though you could swear it was unadorned, he plucks a tiny black raven carved from onyx from his locks and holds it out to you. "If you have the inclination and time to spare between now and when the world ends, seek Lothern and present this to any of the Sea Guard. For ninety-nine days you may call Nagarythe your home, and shall shed blood alongside us to defend it. Our Arhain are not as sought as Saphery's Sariour, but you of the grey of eight may be able to appreciate them."

He bids you farewell and good hunting, and the door closes behind you with the faintest click. You don't hear screams as you walk from the Embassy, but you know that they will come.

Three sapphires twinkle in the crown atop the head of the King as he calls the Council to order once more. "Karagril," he says, "is the last cannon we needed in our parapet. Water, silver, and proof that the Expedition wasn't a fluke." Though there's not as much fire in his voice as you're used to hearing, the steel conviction in it remains unchanged. "All our enemies are at each other's throats. We remain besieged, but in the same way every Hold is; an island of Dawi and Dawri in an ocean of foes. We will abide." His eyes flick to Dreng. "Dreng. To fortify needs not be said, but also probe the other Karags. We were fortunate that only Moulder tried to intervene against us when we marched on Karagril, but the other Karags are now aware we have the ability to project force against them, so we need not hold back. I want to know exactly what dwells in and under each peak." Dreng bangs his fist against his chest in a salute. "Gotri, how goes the shipyard?"

"If it went any better, you'd start seeing river monitors with rotor blades," he says with a smug grin. "Whoever takes over will need to tweak it, of course. Like fitting a suit of chainmail. But I give it three days tops between arrival and laying down the first hull."

"Good. Turn your eyes downwards. I know gyrocopters are your vocation, but we've got one above-ground killing field that I itch for enemies to throw themselves against, and three underground fronts I'm much less happy with. Bring forth the wrath of Morgrim and shore up the Underways."

Prince Gotri gives a single nod. "Engineering is engineering. We manufacture Thaggoraki regret in bulk."

"On that subject. Edda, the Weavers?"

"The Weavers Guilds of the Karaz Ankor have released a united statement condemning the use of spider-silk, saying it is the domain of Elves and Goblins," she says flatly.

"They what?!" Princess Edda opens her mouth to repeat herself, but King Belegar holds up a hand. "No, I heard. I..." He clenches a fist. "I expected Dwarves to act with nobler motives than the self-interest of a Marienburg monopolist. Fine. Fine. Go to the Empire. Find every human weaver worth half a damn, or Halfling weaver or Ogre weaver for all I care, and point them in this direction. They're paid copper, I'm offering silver." He sighs, and closes his eyes for a moment; worried looks are exchanged over the meeting table. "Kazrik. Did you find a wright to go with Gotri's shipyard?"

"Yes," he says quickly, and you have to refrain from sighing in relief. "The Barak Varr Shipwrights Guilds is amiably schisming into the Skarrenokri and the Slotchokri. I've sworn us into a partnership with the Slotchokri, and Zhufbar's and Karak Kadrin's Shipwrights Guilds have done the same. The Skarrenokri are retaining the previous Shipwrights Guild's shipyards - can't have a gap in maintaining the Barak Varr Navy, after all - so the Slotchokri are desperately short of working space until they manage to rearrange the Barak Varr port to fit them in. They say they'll start putting boats into the water for us as soon as they arrive as long as they can build maintenance facilities and a dry-dock at Ulrikadrin to tide them over. Once things are set up for them back in Barak Varr, they'll hand over the facilities to us in payment for their use, and we can retain as much of their service as we'd like to at standard Guild rates."

"Can't ask better than that," King Belegar says. "Now we just need steel-"

"Erm," Prince Kazrik says. "I, that is, we- Karak Azul, that is- we've been accumulating steel since... well, since. Never stopped mining and smelting it, even after there was nobody left to trade it to. And when I checked with Father, his exact words were 'give them every ingot we have and if that's not enough I'll tear more from the mountains with my bare hands' and then he went back to chasing after the few hold-outs left in Karagril."

King Belegar pauses at that, and spends some time searching for words. "The generosity of my Brother-King is everything the Karaz Ankor should strive to be," he says hoarsely. "My thanks. To him and to you. Every ingot will become a weapon protecting Karak Azul's link to the world." He takes a deep breath, and collects his thoughts. "Prince Kazrik. How is your Reikspiel?"

"Better," he says. "I've been spending time amongst the Undumgi whenever I can." King Belegar shoots you a glance, and you simply nod. Prince Kazrik had held a ten-minute conversation with you before the meeting, and though his accent was odd he was certainly fluent.

"Very well. Visit Nuln - it's the Empire's Zhufbar. I've got a treasury full of gold and I want a mountain range full of fire support. Tell them this is their only opportunity to become part of that process before I lay down a cannon foundry right here."

"Manling cannons?" Prince Gotri says dubiously.

"Manling cannons," King Belegar confirms. "And manling mortars, for that matter. And any other Morgrim-forsaken device that can achieve some semblance of accuracy. Enough of the Undumgi have artillerist experience to teach the others." He turns to Gunnars. "Speaking of the Ancestors..."

"Done," he confirms simply. "Grungni, Valaya, Smednir. Morgrim already has a shrine in the gyrocopter bay, Grimnir is served by the Hall of Oaths, and Kragg and Thorek each assured me they've seen to Thungni."

"Good. Once Karagril is secured, see to a proper Temple to Grungni there. We'll be pulling silver ore from the mountains north of Death Pass soon."

"And Smednir?"

"Karag Mhonar was once the home of smelting at Eight Peaks, it will be again. Smednir's home is there." Gunnars nods in acceptance. "If there's no further business?" A round of headshakes. "Very well. Go about it."

---

If anyone noticed your lack of report, they didn't say anything, and you remain seated as the others file out. King Belegar pulls the papers you gave him out from under a few others, and stares down at them again. "Are you seriously-" he stops himself. "First things first. The spiders?"

"First Loremaster got along with them, but couldn't make it work. Still deciding on a second."

"About what I expected. Damn strange creatures. But if we can ever get that damn silk worked, it'll pay for a thousand Loremasters. And Sylvania?"

The papers weren't your only preparation; you've brought a canvas bag, and you produce from it a now-familiar grinning skull. "Alkharad of the Necrarchs. He was hounding the Elector Countess with weekly assassination attempts, and was training up an army of apprentices." You pass the skull underhand to King Belegar, who catches it and returns the skull's smile with a grim one of his own. "Only brought back the Vampire's skull, but the apprentices are dead too. None of the other openly-operating Vampires are in the same league."

"Good." He prods one of the fangs of the skull, then passes it back to you. "Great, in fact. The Empire has not been the most consistent source of assistance, but you get no ore from a shaft you never dig. Okay. Now..."

"The Burning Shadows thing?"

"Yes, the Burning Shadows thing!" You've heard King Belegar angry, but you've never heard him bewildered. "You can weaponize a mountain?!"

"Not on a whim, but yes, with time and equipment-"

"Why am I just hearing about this now?!" He smacks the paper with the back of his hand. "Why was that not how you introduced yourself back in Averland?! 'I'm Mathilde Weber, I can kill things with mountains'."

"So, I take it-"

"Yes! I would like very much for you to put a hard time limit of twenty-four hours on every possible overland siege we could face!" He takes a deep breath. "Okay, first, make damn sure it can't happen by accident or by any hand other than your own, and once you've put your own measures in place to ensure that, get Kragg and get him to add some of his own. But once that's done, yes. Bring in as many Zhufokri as you need, take as much gold and make as many promises as it takes." He shakes his head. "Are there any other apocalypse weapons you've been sitting on that you want to share with me?"

You think of the Aethyric Vitae, of the Liber Mortis, of the Second Secret of Dhar. "None ready for deployment," you hedge.

He stares at you, realizes you aren't joking, and shakes his head. "Zhufokri," he says, stands, and leaves.

"Dawi," you say with a sigh, gathering up your skull.

- I've rearranged and compressed things a little, hopefully this will be a bit less muddled.
- There will be a four hour moratorium.
- AP do not have intrinsic healing properties. Throwing them at King Belegar and hoping it helps is a long shot, and will probably do nothing.
- New overwork system; my thanks to @Redshirt Army for suggesting this model.
- Projects like this one are expected to take two turns, though you can complete it early if you really want to. If you're not finished or want to add more after the year is complete, you can put forward a report on what you've done and what more you want to achieve and King Belegar will consider whether to grant extra time.
