“Go, <i>go</i>!”<br/>
<br/>
It was a killing field, and it held no care for what died within its confines. Whatever these plains might have been, a fortress, a city, it was now nothing more than a heavy flattened plain strewn with debris and indeterminate ruin. No guardsmen dared this place, no stormtrooper’s commander was foolish enough to order them forth. It was not a place for mere mortals, any longer. A dozen and more miles of nothing but dust and death. He ran, heeding the words, leaping over the husk of a ruined Baneblade, cored straight through the middle. Sweat soaked through his torn uniform, blood from his wounds splattering on the ground as he sprinted forwards, a thin whining noise the only warning before another blast tore through the space he had just occupied.<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Roman ran, even though he knew it was pointless. It was, at least, better than simply waiting to die in the flaming ruins of their now lost charge. Blaring litanies of hatred and hymns to the God-Emperor announced the arrival of their own brothers in battle, but he did not recognize the insignias on the Baneblade that burst past them, unable to stop even to pause and recognize the surviving crew. Roman knew it well enough. He’d passed others like him before from within the <i>Triumph of Hate</i>, over the past few hours. He hadn’t spared any pity then, and he didn’t ask for it now. All that mattered now was survival, and survival lay on the horizon, where the kasr still stood, its guns firing up into the sky against the endless swarms of bombers and fighters above.<br/>
<br/>
“Colonel, please,” wheezed his main gunner, “Just let me…,”<br/>
<br/>
“Lay down and <i>die</i>, Malakai?” The Cadian sneered. “If you must, do so now, and save us the time wasted pulling you out of the <i>Triumph</i> and putting you on the stretcher.”<br/>
<br/>
He was, of course, being entirely facetious. They weren’t going to abandon anyone, now. Speed wouldn’t matter. There was no chance they would make it all the way back to the kasr before they all died. But he would not die laying down. He was of <i>Cadia</i>, and he would die standing if he had anything to say about it. Other members of his crew grimly nodded, continuing to drag the partially disemboweled and thoroughly burned Malakai with them atop their makeshift stretcher. It was a moment of complete impossible defiance against the fate they knew was coming, breathing when they should have ceased, and yet they continued.<br/>
<br/>
“Down, everyone down,” someone hissed, and without question they did so.<br/>
<br/>
Malakai even had the strength to not wheeze when he struck the packed earth.<br/>
<br/>
A pack of soul grinders shrieked past, from the same direction the Baneblade had come, and in that simple appearance and continued movement they lost just one more scrap of hope. The sheer amount of munitions being expended here, between practically every vehicle fieldable in the arsenal of the Imperial Guard and the same from the forces of Chaos save <i>only</i> for Knights or Titans, was deafening. A tank could drive past, be torn asunder moments later, and they might not have heard it. The same, it seemed, in the case of the foreign Baneblade. The soul grinders cackled, slick with gore and oil, as they stomped and clattered their way further into the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
“All right, everyone get ready,” Roman grunted, “There has to be a hunk of metal <i>somewhere</i> on this battlefield that’s still movement-capable, maybe one with just its crew dead.”<br/>
<br/>
“What if-,”<br/>
<br/>
And then they died, as another of the Valdor tanks, freshly crafted from the forges of the Dark Mechanicus within the Eye of Terror, burned them down to the molecular level. For a time, the daemon who had consumed the crew had hunted, amused by their pathetic struggle to survive. But the pressing will of its greater masters had pressed down upon it, and forced it unto termination. The rest of its pack, all Valdor tanks as well from the same forge, shuddered as they felt the approach. And then, so too did the delicious souls which dared to face them. It was one thing to face Baneblades, Valdors, Shadowswords, and other things long corrupted by the taint of the Warp. It was impressive that the Imperium had responded in kind, deploying so many to one single battlefield to one single Cadian kasr on the very most hard-fought crisis points on the planet. But now, it all would come to an end.<br/>
<br/>
The House of Serrated Souls, its old name lost to time, had come. A Knightly House, once, as one they let loose a wild chorus of screams. Every pilot, subsumed, yet the power undeniable enough to ensure that another would be drawn in. All while the original pilots, those of the true House, who had followed noble Horus into damnation. Warnings screeched across the vox, as did the outrage of the Adeptus Mechanicus at seeing such venerable machines ruined so. Thirty entire Chaos Knights strode forth, wielding weapons of annihilation and horror, in some cases possessing grafted neutron laser projectors from the recently mastered Valdor design, and brought a complete end to the stalemate. And as scavengers follow lions, so too did other daemon-engines emerge, floatsam of the oncoming storm. Decimators and Maulerfiends, more soul grinders and even simply roving packs of daemons that spawned into being. They overwhelmed the regiments embattled, and rushed further on, the battlefield lost. By now, the Adeptus Administratum had simply given up on naming every single battle, thrust, feint, and skirmish. There was no point.<br/>
<br/>
They advanced upon the kasr, all of them, firing carelessly with all they had upon the cities shielded walls.<br/>
<br/>
And yet…the gates began to open, driving the daemon-engines only to greater lust for destruction and blood. A surrender? How delicious, that they would think such a thing was even possible!<br/>
<br/>
And then, bearing the sigils of Kaurava’s forges, did a hundred Baneblades come roaring out of the city’s gates, and a dozen Shadowsword’s behind them bearing the marks of their individual Forge Worlds. Three of Cadia’s five Valdor tanks came as well.<br/>
<br/>
It was not a battlefield for simple flesh. It was for metal and thunder, that place, no other was allowed. Nothing else could survive. A confluence of destruction, unique in its state, yet commonplace in its stature and breadth. Armory Worlds emptied, and pacts with daemons struck, did the Mechanicus…<i>both</i> of them, exercise their pure hatred for one another. The split between the Omnissiah and his faithful, supposed or otherwise, only increased the carnage in coming days. And despite the Adeptus Administratum ceasing to put even the barest effort in categorizing each and every battle properly with anything other than numbers, it would spread. Kasr Peloa would know, and in time, the Field of Steel grew in its own way of legends. It did so now. It would do so again when the House of Black Screams fought against the House Lionis. When the Legio Furorumis battled an entirely unknown and unidentified Legio of Chaos, whose heraldry was utterly unknown to the records of either Mechanicus and Imperium.<br/>
<br/>
In time, even when the battles moved on and Kasr Peloa burned to the ground, it was whispered that the sheer amount of machine spirits lost there could still be heard on fell nights.<br/>
<br/>
All the while, the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade ground on.</div>
