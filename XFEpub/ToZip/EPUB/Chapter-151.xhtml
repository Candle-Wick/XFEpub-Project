    <h2>076.M42 Interlude: Forcible Feasting</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>076.M42 Interlude: Forcible Feasting</b><br/>​</div>Tendrils of thought-flesh extended through the burning void. <br/>
<br/>
Pinpricks across light years and light years, as prey fought back in limited instances.<br/>
<br/>
Feast-lights flickering and burning. <br/>
<br/>
Greater concentrations of feast-lights? Yes. Feast. Devour. Biomass and body and That-Which-Is-Not-Yet and would – <i>must</i> – become That-Which-Is.<br/>
<br/>
Tendrils burnt. Tendrils engorged. Success. Failure. <br/>
<br/>
Loss of connection. Reconnection. Loss of connection while retaining awareness. <br/>
<br/>
Threat?<br/>
<br/>
Unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Information required. <br/>
<br/>
A tendril twists, turns, crushes gravity and reality together through the Will of That-Which-Is. <br/>

<div style="text-align: center">=====================================================<br/>​</div>The Warp near the Eye of Terror was, on the best of days, anarchic and deadly. As the 13th Black Crusade had continued, it had only become worse. Astropaths and Navigators fought their own desperate battles through the Immaterium on a daily basis, just as the ships and crews of the Imperial Navy that ferried them about. Just as the Imperial Guard, Sororitas, Mechanicus, and Adeptus Astartes did on a thousand battlefields strewn about various Sectors. This made the change that much more noticeable, for the sheer fact that quieting the Warp in such a manner was beyond perhaps all but the Necrons and their Pylons – a quietly propagated fact whose continued propagation infuriated the Inquisition quite a bit. But given previous events, it was not, in fact, an utterly unexpected arrival. It couldn't be, when similar events had occurred less than a century ago with the aftereffects currently still battling the Daemon Primarch Angron. <br/>
<br/>
That had not, however, quite prepared anyone for multiple Hive Ships to appear not just near Subiaco Diablo Prime where that same battle was still ongoing, but across the Cadian Sector as well. This was no mundane Splinter Fleet, either. Panicked Administratum Adepts conferred with Astra Militarum Adepts, historians and scholars of military history frantically trying to disprove the reality in front of them. To their credit, it was not as if all information across the Cadian Sector could be collated correctly or swiftly. The Great WAAAAGH!! had managed to involve greenskins on multiple worlds, their scrap ships and kill kroozers combatting the battered ships of the Imperium, the monstrous vessels of Chaos, and the utterly mad and crazed Necron ships of the Bone Kingdom. For while the latter's Overlord had been utterly destroyed by the Despoiler, it was a tremendous task for any to even contest even the smallest of the Necron ships despite the total degradation of their crews. While there were far fewer of these xenos vessels than any other, a bare handful had been destroyed since their initial arrival in the Cadian Sector. Battles and details were such that more than a few cogitators had burnt out trying to catalogue it all. <br/>
<br/>
But it was true, nonetheless. Maddeningly, terrifyingly, true. <br/>
<br/>
It is said that the Great Prophet, Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, let loose a bellowing laugh that could be heard by both Chaos and Imperial lines on Cadia itself when the first of the Hive Ships arrived, letting loose millions of termagaunts and hormagaunts directly onto the Kasrs and horrid bastions that the forces of the Despoiler had lashed together over the years on the planet's surface. Bioplasma and acid-carrying borers flooded the battles of the void, splashing against and melting the hulls of all a manner of ships. Blasphemous artifice of the Dark Mechanicus, wondrous creations of Mars and other loyal Forge Worlds, absurd amalgamations of scrap and wire from ork meks, or impossible metals of the Necron, it did not matter. There was a tremendous amount of psychic energy across the Cadian Sector, a perfect beacon for the Hive Mind, not just from the humans, but from the greenskins as well. <br/>
<br/>
A thousand betrayals and flash alliances came into being and were carried out over the next few months. Heretics and loyalists fired as one upon Hive Ships before resuming shooting at one another. A trio of kill kroozers joyfully rammed into an enormous Devourer, stopping it from clamping its mouth around a Lunar-class cruiser bearing the markings of Khorne. A pair of Razorfiends belched forth bio acid upon a Scythe-class Harvester Ship of the Bone Kingdom, burning away at its regenerating hull, while an enterprising Imperial Captain managed to line up a Nova Cannon shot to tear huge chunks out of all three combatants. At other times, the ships of the Despoiler and of the Imperium danced away from each other, each trying to ensure that the other was targeted by the tyranids instead. Ork ships didn't particularly care, and fired in all directions whenever and wherever they could. <br/>
<br/>
Void prowlers targeted convoys of troops on the way to planetary battlefields, regardless of their heraldry. Drone ships clouded around larger battleships through the void, charging forward and latching on with their gaping maws to begin biting open holes to deposit borders down. Humongous numbers of spore mines began floating down through the atmospheres of a dozen worlds, falling against and exploding upon fortifications and defenses of all a manner of armies. Some even fell atop ritual sites of the Despoiler's sorcerous cabals, disrupting summoning rituals that had been letting loose floods of daemons upon the battlefield. After the initial wave of smaller creatures had been deployed, a second wave of tens of thousands of Mycetic Spores dropped, these ones carrying higher bio-forms. Warriors and carnifexes came stomping out, roaring and charging at their prey. Raveners slipped below the earth, while lictors simply faded from sight moments after touching soil. <br/>
<br/>
The Cadian Gate was flooded beyond bursting with grudges and hatreds going back for thousands of years. Of ancient rivalries, and ones freshly born. The grand ambitions of Chaos Lords and Imperial Generals, the desires of the Great Prophet and those greenskins who followed him. Pain, horror, glory, honor, hope, all of these things and more that were held high by all those who fought one another, these were topics for lesser beings. Lesser things. Prey. All that the Hive Mind cared for was the feast, the consumption, the taking of That-Which-Was-Not and transforming it into That-Which-Is. A hundred plots and plans, for betrayal and aid, for attack and defense, collapsed under the chitinous tide that had come for them all. <br/>
<br/>
The Despoiler raged. The Great Prophet laughed. The Saints Celestine and Sabbat set their shoulders and soldiered on. The leaderless Necrons of the Bone Kingdom ferally lashed out as the curse of a dead C'tan burned their minds and souls eternally. <br/>
<br/>
Leviathan, the true Leviathan, not puppets of a daemon, had come.<br/>
<br/>
And the 13th Black Crusade ground on.</div>
