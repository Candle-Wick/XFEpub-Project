    <h2>Waaagh Birdmuncha, Part 1</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Sleep.
[*] Spend time with Belegar and the War Council as the plans for the coming battle are revised and refined.



It hasn't been an especially long day, but it has been a very busy and tiring day. With the hold back in King Belegar's capable hands, you take the opportunity to sate the hunger you've only just noticed and get an early night.

You rise and greet the day several hours before dawn, only slightly delayed by having to scrub dried Skaven blood from your gun belt before handing command of the penthouse over to Wolf and clambering atop your summoned Shadowsteed and yawning and grumbling your way down the great stairs of Karag Nar. It's a sight the locals have long since grown accustomed to, but currently there are none to see - most of the civilians are all out helping prepare the battlefield while those who will shed blood in the morning are still peacefully asleep. Then you emerge, scowling up at the crescent of Morrsleib spilling a faint green light over the landscape and pointing your steed down the path between Nar and the Citadel, a recently-cobbled road between fields of cabbages and onions.

Dwarves are able to fight off the symptoms of a lack of sleep for longer than humans can, which on top of increasing the number of hands that are busy shaping the battlefield, also means that King Belegar has been spending the night working on the plan for the coming day and will not suffer for it. You raise a hand in greeting as you enter and accept a flask of something that burns going down from Princess Edda and peer around the table, and are glad to see the rest of the Council plus King Kazador, Kragg, and Thorek. King Kazador has apparently set up a horse relay in the Underway between Karak Azul and Eight Peaks, which has seen little use but has just shown its worth in returning Dreng and Prince Gotri from Karak Azul overnight and only slightly battered for the experience.

"Here's where we're at," King Belegar says, waving a hand up at the MAP still floating above the table, which is now supplemented by what looks like a number of coloured balls hanging from the ceiling from string. "Western Gate is out of the question, I've had some lads over there and if we had a year we could make it impenetrable, but with one night it'll cost more lives to defend than it will cost the enemy to take. So for the purposes of this battle, it's an open door. As for the rest of it, we can hold Kvinn-Wyr with a quarter of the Undumgi, about the same for Huzkul and the Karak Drazh Underway, and the Ranger cordon will suffice for Zilfin and Yar - bloody Eshin melted a hole in the side of Yar and must have clambered all the way down the mountain to leg it, so they're out of the picture."

You furrow your brow and concentrate, and then a wave of your hand alters the MAP accordingly, and Princess Edda gives a sigh of relief as she climbs up atop the table to start removing the balls. "Raw maths for the gate," she says as she works. "Assuming skinny orcs that are okay with sharing their personal space, twenty can fit through at a time. They need less space at a march and they'll come through faster at a run so it's a wash, so call it twenty a second."

"Assuming they go straight for the Citadel at maximum speed," Prince Gotri picks up, "not unlikely since it's the only thing that looks blatantly like a fight to be had, it's a matter of minutes before they enter into ideal range of most of our artillery, which is also about where Master Weber's trump card can no longer reach them. At this point, there's maybe ten thousand in the Caldera."

"So that's..." you pause and try to think. "Not even three percent."

"First decision," King Belegar says. "Do we let them get just enough in to make it hurt and then hit them on the nose, or do we wait for them to become too invested to pull out before we unleash the Eye of Gazul on them?" He hands you a sketch, and you frown at it and then make the suggested tweaks to the MAP. "Assuming they're sensible enough to not keep putting forces through that get melted, they'll start looking for alternate ways to get in. We've plugged Yar's escape route, as well as other fissures, towers, and side-doors, but our problem is the Wyvern Caves on Zilfin. They haven't actually held Wyverns since the days of the ancestors, when Grimnir slew them and they fed him and Grungni and Valaya during their work here, but they are a massive network of caves, too massive to block off in the time we have. We could take a heavy toll off them trying to climb up or build their way up it, but we'd also be exposed to anything they might have in the way of siege weapons or other surprises. It's also below the point the Ice Dragon has 'claimed'." He doesn't look happy at that, but he doesn't contest it, either. "Alternately, we can let enough through that they can't disengage before we unveil the Eye. They'd likely throw the full power of any Shamans they have against contesting it, but..." You're already smiling in anticipation, and he nods. "That's unlikely to be a problem. What will be a problem is that any that survive - the ones in the eastern edge of the Caldera - will be looking for an escape. And that means they're likely to push on Karagril and Karag Mhonar, which they should be able to reach the blocked entrances of without becoming vulnerable to the Eye, and they'd have enough reason to start excavating them."

"I couldn't dream of a better killing field than the Caldera," Prince Gotri says with a smile.

"I could," says King Kazador. "Halfway up a mountain."

"Second, how we react to intrusion, either the Wyvern Caves being reached or the Karag entrances being breached. We can hold them until forced to fall back - which I envision to be a long and very bloody fight, but though we'll take a heavy toll from the enemy, they will be costing us lives. Or we could prepare fallback positions, traps, explosives, and all sorts of other ugly surprises throughout the entire mountains, make every step cost them in blood while barely exposing our own forces to them."

"You can't just give up Karags to-" Princess Edda begins.

"We'll retake them once the fight has gone out of them, but as much as they're needed for long-term defences, we don't need them now," King Belegar says firmly. "We live in two mountains and we could make it one without stepping on each other's toes. If taking those mountains bleeds the Waaagh of bodies and motivation, there's no reason not to consider it."  Nobody looks pleased at that, but eventually there's nods all around as they see the sense in it. "The point where we fight to the end is further in. The Citadel can hold for a century if need be, but it's not only the Citadel that we must defend. Karag Lhune and Karag Nar must be defended, as well as maintaining some link between them and the Citadel to prevent defeat in detail, either the Underway or the Eastern Valley. So the final line will be either the Underway at two points, between Karagril and Lhune and between Kvinn-Wyr and Mhonar, which gives us the smallest possible frontage but moves most of the fronts underground, or pull out of Kvinn-Wyr altogether, which forces us to contest the Eastern Valley to keep the Citadel connected but brings the entire battle above-ground, and thus vulnerable to gyrocopters and the Eye of Gazul."

"Twenty to one," Prince Kazrik says darkly, and all eyes turn to the wall, where a dagger driven with supernatural strength has pinned the High King's missive to the wall for all to see.

"Eight, actually," Princess Edda says. "Twenty-five thousand Dwarves under arms of Eight Peaks. Ten thousand from Karak Azul. Six thousand Undumgi. Five thousand Fieldwardens. Four thousand mercenaries. That's fifty thousand in the field, against four hundred thousand Orcs."

"Eight to one," Prince Kazrik says, more thoughtfully now.

"Is that all?" King Kazador says with a snort. "If I'd realized, I wouldn't have bothered to be up this early." There's chuckles from some and smiles from others, and the mood of the room lightens. You look up and gesture, and the eastern end of the MAP falls away, bringing the Caldera and the Western Gate into closer focus, and a thought highlights everywhere the Eye of Gazul can reach a deep, glowing red.

"Right," says King Belegar. "First line first. Let's hear your opinions."

---

When should the Eye of Gazul first be fired at the Waaagh?
[ ] FIRST LINE: Caldera
Let enough forces through the Western Gates before unveiling the Eye of Gazul that they can't practically disengage. This will likely mean that large numbers will be shielded by the eastern edge of the Caldera, and Karagril, Karag Mhonar, and the Citadel will have to hold with conventional siege weapons.
[ ] FIRST LINE: Western Gates
Give any force foolish enough to enter the Western Gates the full power of the Eye of Gazul. This makes it almost certain they will seek entry elsewhere, most likely via the Wyvern Caves, which will have to be defended the normal way - if a defensive position kilometers above the ground can be considered 'normal'.

How should the forces of Eight Peaks react to intrusions to the Karags?
[ ] SECOND LINE: Hold
Build strong fortifications along the lines the greenskins are expected to approach from, and if they seek a way in use a wall of lead to keep them out. These points will only be abandoned if they become overwhelmed.
[ ] SECOND LINE: Withdraw
Set up a fighting retreat through a dozen or more defensive positions through each mountain, making them bleed for each step without significantly endangering any friendly forces.

What should be the final line of defence, which will be held to the bitter end?
[ ] THIRD LINE: Eastern Valley
Give up Kvinn-Wyr and the Sentinels, and allow the southern half of the Eastern Valley to become the final battlefield.
[ ] THIRD LINE: Underway
Hold the line at the Underway between Lhune and Karagril, and between Kvinn-Wyr and Mhonar.


- The decision needs to be made now, so the preparations can begin. The Waaagh cannot be scouted until dawn, at which point it could already be as little as an hour from the Western Gates.
- Depending on where the Waaagh is, there might be the opportunity to make further personal preparations before they arrive, but you do not know if that is the case yet.
- There will be a two hour moratorium, and voting will not be in plan format.
