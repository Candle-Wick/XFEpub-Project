The galaxy churns with ever increasing war despite the turn of the millennium. You gaze upon various data slates and the reports therein even as serfs manning the communication arrays of the Battle Barge declare that a great Ark Mechanicus and several attending ships has appeared out of the Warp and set up around the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i>. They are welcome to the blasted thing. <i>You</i> must concern yourself with the greater galaxy for this moment.<br/>
<br/>
At Cadia the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade has continued into the 42<span style="vertical-align:super">nd​</span> Millennium. Some might see it as a foreboding omen that one of the greatest displays of violence and war in the Imperium was ongoing at the end and beginning of an entire thousand years. Others might disregard any attempt at such poeticism and move onto more practical matters. Troops are being organized throughout the Imperium to head not just to the latest war for Armageddon but for the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade. Over thirty different chapters have involved themselves including what appears to be nearly the whole of the Space Wolves and even the mysterious Grey Knights with whom the Blood Ravens were once trusted. Before Kyras and his traitors compounded every little suspicion anyone has ever held for your chapter. Trust will be in ever short supply these days, especially after the apparently devastating Betrayal On Cadia – or so that terrible event is known amongst the reports being passed by the astropaths.<br/>
<br/>
You can only hope that rumors of Eldar involvement are not true but if they are then you worry further for the future of the Imperial forces present. It <i>would</i> be in their treacherous nature to ruin the efforts of good men and women for some foreign and inexplicable reason even if Chaos is present in such force.<br/>
<br/>
The War for Armageddon has actually slowed down despite everyone’s assumption otherwise as numerous ork forces lifted off in search of an apparent better fight. Said better fight is apparently Octarius. While even more orks travelling to such a place is not necessarily the best possible thing to see when there are yet more Splinter Fleets that have been sighted traveling in that direction any respite for the beleaguered defenders of Armageddon is surely welcome. Though there seem to be ever more Tyranids these days considering that Imperial spies and Rogue Traders may or may not have reported that the Tau are being forced to heavily fortify their Empire’s ‘rear’ that has never tasted Imperial assault. Rumors of new Splinter Fleets abound, but nothing is certain these days.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
But if there is anything that has truly surprised you, it is the fact that even while you had begun marshalling your meagre forces for the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade you received a message from the Grey Knights which acknowledged ‘Your contribution to the defense of Cadia’. The problem with that of course is that you <i>hadn’t</i> done any such thing yet. While there is little chance for you to have ever refused attending to the Black Crusade yourself due to the nature of the Blood Raven’s relationship with the rest of the Imperium being in its current state, apparently you are already there in some measure or another. The rest of the Chapter’s leadership was in similar confused states when you broke the news upon them until you opened up the secondary attachments which actually described the Blood Ravens present on Cadia.<br/>
<br/>
Aramus.<br/>
<br/>
His Penitent Crusade took him towards the Eye of Terror. How could <i>he</i> refuse to fight in the name of the Imperium if he is present? A total lack of communication with him had honestly led you to believe that he had likely died in the fight but apparently you had once again underestimated the marine. You had only ever seen him in battle personally once but his feats are legendary amongst the Chapter even now. Battling the Great Unclean One Ulkair, battling and defeating an <i>Avatar of Khaine</i> in hand to hand combat with a small scattering of marines alongside him. Everything else done in the Aurelian Crusades before you had dismissed him. The force that accompanied him and may even now be fighting and dying on Cadian soil was that same taskforce that had fought in the aforementioned Crusades save for the lack of certain individuals who remain with you…and yet it is no full company.<br/>
<br/>
The Imperium apparently sees Aramus and his force as a worthy contribution or the Grey Knights would not have spared the limited time and lifeforce of an astropath to transmit the message with alacrity.<br/>
<br/>
Do you?<br/>
<br/>
You have promised Zerann forces in the near future, can you risk what troops you have in the unbearably destructive crucible of a Black Crusade or can you allow Aramus to find his penitence there while in turn granting the Blood Ravens precious time to rebuild?<br/>
<br/>
What shall you do?<br/>

<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos </u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos and Chief Librarian Probalis are mighty champions and <i>can</i> be deployed on operations. They need not remain in the <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> doing nothing.<br/>
- You are slow. This must no longer be. Your agility <i>must</i> be bettered, you cannot allow these bionics to slow you forever! - While your Chapter rebuilds, it may be time to consider rebuilding the amount of Gene-Seed you possess through faster means i.e. test-slaves now that the <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> has been repaired.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Nero Gracchus – Chief Apothecary (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Create Test-Slaves for artificial gene-seed implantation. It is a desperate measure, but some might say a necessary one given how little of the precious stuff the Chapter possesses.<br/>
[] Write-In<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus </u><br/>
- We are in dire need for more gene-seed!<br/>
- If we could better understand our gene-seed, perhaps we could better improve survival rates for implantation?<br/>
- The Apothecarium really does need more, well, Apothecaries.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Martellus Ravias – Master of the Forge (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Build Order (250 BP Available)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of the Forge Ravias</u><br/>
- While the Chapter’s numbers remain as they are, we should turn to the Tarantula Turret. It can hold the positions we simply do not have the numbers to hold. They certainly held up quite well when I was alone on Typhon against everything that world threw against me.<br/>
- We need a bit of everything when it comes to equipment these days.<br/>
- The Forge could use more of my peers, though I would have to train them from the ground up of course.</div>
