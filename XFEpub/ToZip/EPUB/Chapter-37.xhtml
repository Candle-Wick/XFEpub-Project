[X] Join The Lines - The Skitarii are currently in a seemingly endless back and forth with the rest of Aerus. While the penetrating spearhead strikes of the Blood Ravens have prevented the stalemate from falling in the wrong direction, some front-line assistance for properly equipped dreadnoughts and terminators could likely assist the Mechanicus forces in pushing further forward in general. With your own vehicles, and heavy weaponry, this could be made possible. The further the line stretches and expands, the better it will be for all. And at the least, you would not be sending astartes into enemy territory and instead they would be fighting alongside allies. Another half of the 1st Company led by Ares Actus is shifting towards this theater of the battlefield to slay and fight.<br/>

+008.M42+<br/>
+<i>To Hate Without Compromise Is A Virtue</i>+</b><br/>​</div>“Greetings Chapter Master Angelos.Gabriel,” hums a skitarii with a half dozen arms bearing bolters and lasguns sprouting from the back. “It is good that you-,”<br/>
<br/>
And then a tank round blows the upper half of the skitarri apart on its way to impact against a nearby tarantula turret which screeches and slumps towards the ground slightly before a frankly horrified screech of binary erupts from the vocoder of a nearby tech priest who unceremoniously sprints over and begins to beseech the machine to continue its functioning. All around you the scene repeats itself. While the Mechanicus has been fighting for a long while here, just as the last time they simply were not able to yet bring forward to bear the sheer firepower required to battle the sheer tonnage of insane tanks driven towards them at this single point.<br/>
<br/>
It is lucky, then, that your Chief Librarian had scryed this point before it could fully collapse. Just as he had the past three times, and likely would further at later points during your work along these lines. Without prompting, Marcus pushes forward atop the land raider, while Apollo charges forth and begins to beat a tank into pieces that might once have been a noble predator. Yet this one possessed far too many eyes, too many fleshy appendages pulling and ripping outwards in grasping motions. Your own vehicles push forward and unleash their fury, while strategically placed tarantula turrets across the entire line at points known to have otherwise been weak without them take their own toll upon the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the type of warfare that space marines are normally meant for, you know. In point of fact, such protracted near on trench warfare where every inch is fought over and a relentless defense against a foe upon open ground and a series of defensive positions is more reminiscent to the work of space marines in the times of the Great Crusade. That is not to say that your forces are squandered in this. Instead you act as perhaps the reverse of a spear tip, a sudden and impenetrable shield that appears whenever the cyborg warriors and skitarri of the Mechanicus weaken. They possess their own armored forces, and yet so much of their attention is further spent on continuing to preserve and purify the land they have reclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Thus it falls to you. To the Blood Ravens, and the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian as well. Who have their own tanks to attribute. It is, for sure, a glorious sight for some as so many space marine vehicles let loose upon the foe in continuous bursts of melta and lascannon fire, aided by many a Leman Russ which boom and shred with their own cannons and bolters. And yet perhaps the greatest of work comes from Justinius himself, who in a great feat of his psychic talents unleashes some form of field of power which weakens the very metal itself of the maddened mass of machine and metal which has come so close to shattering the lines of the skitarrii.<br/>
<br/>
The fight goes on, and to the credit of all you do not suffer a single fatality, at least one in point of flesh. So hardly pressed was the line during all of this, that many of Martellus’ precious turrets find themselves blown into utter scrap as the furious monstrosities of Aerus find their very presence offensive to them it seems so often do they focus upon them. Plenty of Leman Russ tanks are further torn to shreds though not so completely as they cannot be repaired by the extremely near tech priests who can pull them to high quality facilities then and there. Of the two mighty predators of the chapter left in the vehicle pool, untainted by Chaos or destroyed by traitors, one is badly damaged though it should be fixable in the future.<br/>
<br/>
As for the turrets, the same cannot be said, yet they surely did the best that their machine spirits could provide, slaying many a tank, cyborg, and monstrosity before being brought down. And though you would not say it to Martellus who you would almost swear is wearing sigils in <i>remembrance of the lost turrets</i> on his armor, you are of the firm belief that you would rather they be destroyed than another Blood Raven lost on this world. There is a bright spot in the Master of the Forge’s world however, a point of piousness and armoring granted to him by your own request as he finishes construction not just on one of your trainee chaplains now whose reply was in near inhuman decibels as well as a new and sacred Land Raider Crusader.<br/>
<br/>
You do wish that he had not named it <i>Tarantalus Ultima</i>, though. But despite the strangeness of its name, you know that his work is exemplary and that in the future it shall likely more than prove itself in its own storied actions just as the <i>Litany of Purgation</i> has in its own long history. Hopefully. So long as Martellus does not attempt to sequester it somehow out of the almost fatherly concern he shows for his creations.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
================================<br/>
[Training With Apollo – Agility From 5 to 6: 511+46+Apollo(29)+(Turn 10 Retroactive of 29)=615/600]<br/>
[Chapter Training – Toughness: 445+53+Marcus(25)=523/600]<br/>
[Chapter Training – Ballistic Skill: 169+16+Macharius(25)=210/500]<br/>
[Chapter Training – Agility: 27+Kaius(25)=52/500]<br/>​</div>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Mechanicus was eager to prove their efforts at cleansing the planet successful. The last thing any of them wanted was for the Inquisition to come by and attempt to cleanse it in their own ruinous manner. While the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian had already faced the vagaries of Chaos and been judged able to continue by the Inquisition during the Aurelian Crusades, that did not stop the fear of being purged at another time. As such, freshly fabricated bolters and combat knives were pushed into the hands of your brothers as they trained in cleared areas on the planet to both test themselves and the restored manufactorums of Aerus.<br/>
<br/>
In a grand circuit were those not fighting at crisis points along the Skitarii Lines throughout the year forced into small arenas similar to the cages that other chapters might have possessed, and battered themselves senseless as they attempted to match the sheer unadulterated toughness of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Captain. For hours they fought, marine after marine leaping forward to grapple in combat with Marcus only for the scarred astartes to beat them senseless and take every blow they could unleash without pause. In turn they would be beaten upon in turn, bellowed litanies of will and strength from the throats of stalking Chaplains and the Captain himself inflaming them.<br/>
<br/>
Those that could stumble away found weapons pressed into their hands by Macharius who was as unforgiving and cold-voiced as the most impartial of Iron Hands and eldest of Mechanicus adepts. When they failed their shots, they were forced to make five more successful ones than what they missed at. This resulted in a simply tremendous expenditure of ammo upon targets that the Mechanicus was only happy to allow as they relentlessly checked over every magazine and bolter round, every gun present as well so that they could check for signs of impurity and corruption.<br/>
<br/>
Some had to be torn from the grips of the space marines present and melted into blocks of metal requiring prayer and ritual purification, but statistically these occurrences were few. Even less so when the eye-less Codicier Nero began to wander his way through the area with strange and unerring direction.<br/>
<br/>
Others still found themselves plunged into a near-deadly game of hide and seek, new recruits of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company and those of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company who had grown complacent against the lumbering speeds of the inhabitants of Aerus facing one who had gained the approval of the quiet and taciturn master of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company. From one who had been a deadly kill marine flowed knowledge of melding with shadows, lessons that had served Cyrus well against even some of the best of the despicable eldar race. From that, came Kaius. For those who had seen him bearing a flamer in battle and screaming as loud as any other, for a fully armored battle brother to disappear and reappear from the shadows was more than enough motivation. The blades lightly run across space marine throats just light enough to draw a single bead of blood simply went even further.<br/>
<br/>
And you fought yourself against Apollo in a resounding series of matches that brought curious observers from your own brothers, those of the Mechanicus, and the awed guardsmen of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian. These last would not normally be permitted into such a place, but under Hannibal’s impassioned sermons who were you to refuse? In doing so you demonstrated just who and what was aiding the Imperial Guard in this battle, and in seeing your own prowess found more faith in their own. Disheartened by so many losses, they found themselves buoyed by faith and grit in reserves that they had lost sight of.<br/>
<br/>
That this turned many who were wavering into turning in their comrades who had begun to bear tainted trinkets stolen in battle, mutations brought about by battling on a world so corrupted for so long, was simply a greater boon. Those priests present may have been vastly distrustful of your chapter, but the presence and stern hatred of your chaplains may have, in some small yet brutal way, proved yourselves.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
==============================​</div> <br/>
“All of you are now Aspirants of the Blood Ravens,” Cyrus called out as he stalked back and forth in front of the bloodied and bruised survivors of the trials.<br/>
<br/>
At his words, some perked up, yet others did not. This was a world that, while it had known of the Emperor, surely had not the same devotion and surety in the Emperor as a Cardinal World might. But they would learn as they needed to. Besides which, it was not as if space marines were meant to have fallen into the easy mental trap of worshipping a God rather than serving the Emperor. If anything, that fact was one that Cyrus would be able to use to his advantage as he pushed them through training, though with wary eyes he watched those of them that both he and the Epistolary which traveled with him and seen the curse of psyker talents who had fought and won.<br/>
<br/>
“You shall learn from me. And you shall serve the Emperor in all things.”<br/>
<br/>
With that, Cyrus tossed his bolter into the waiting hands of his newly arrived Chaplain, and raised his fists.<br/>
<br/>
“Now. All of you. Come at me at once, and we shall see if you are worthy of taking the <i>next</i> step.”<br/>

<u>Aerus Warfare Decisions (49% of Aerus Reclaimed/Reclaimed Area rated as Extremis-grade Defenses By Mechanicus/Orbital Drop,Thunderhawk Transport Allowed Within Reclaimed Territory Due To Lack of Daemon-slaved AA Batteries):</u><br/>
[] Patrol the Reclaimed Zone - Is subject to semi-regular ambushes, machine creature infiltrators, mutated creatures appearing through ruined sewers and pipes. Recent aid by way of the numerous turrets of the Chapter's forges being put to use has greatly assisted in this. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span>Meridian's morale is on the rise, as it can patrol without assured casualties every single hour now.  The Mechanicus has been able to work with better ease at restoring the area, building up their own defenses, etc. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Target An Aerus Daemonforge - One of the tainted manufactorums which continually spill out a mixture of random possessed machinery, horrific cybernetic monstrosities, etc. behind the ‘enemy lines’ which are currently fighting against the streaming hordes of Skitarii. Another has been located through the efforts of the Chief Librarian and the tacticians of the Mechanicus, and as such the whole of the 1st Company and their newly recovered members are gearing up to ride out and destroy it. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Break Mad Machine Mass, a grouping of insane tanks and armored carriers whose Machine Spirits have gone mad and are traveling as one mass and attacking everyone and everything they can, heading straight for the Skitarii Lines. The latest was slain with minor Mechanicus casualties, and so now the nearest is in the far distance within non-reclaimed Aerus territory. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Attack Abominable Quasi-Titan – Aerus did not have a Titan Legion on its own, but apparently it’s twisted ghosts are determined to produce their own. Out of daemonflesh, rusted cable, and random scrap and weaponry scattered across the land, are titan-sized creatures crafted by mad machine spirits and corrupted programming. They are rare, but especially dangerous. A pair of these have arisen, of similar size to a Warhound Titan each, and are slowly beginning to make their way towards the Skitarri lines. With each mile of land they progress across more and more scrap metal and material is growing onto them, increasing their size and deadliness.  (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Join The Lines - The Skitarii are currently in a seemingly endless back and forth with the rest of Aerus. While the penetrating spearhead strikes of the Blood Ravens have prevented the stalemate from falling in the wrong direction, some front-line assistance for properly equipped dreadnoughts and terminators could likely assist the Mechanicus forces in pushing further forward in general. With your own vehicles, and heavy weaponry, this could be made possible. The further the line stretches and expands, the better it will be for all. And at the least, you would not be sending astartes into enemy territory and instead they would be fighting alongside allies. (Write-In Forces)<br/>

<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos, Chief Librarian Probalis, and Apollo are mighty champions and <i>can</i> be deployed on operations. They need not remain in their ships doing nothing. To have them participate in an operation, it must be specified that they do so.<br/>
- You have access to a number of veterans who could impart their knowledge and skills upon your ranks, an especially important thing now that it is likely that many scouts will soon be promoted to full battle brothers. Not just in one way, but more. You have the exceptional battle brothers for it, after all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus</u><br/>
- The Apothecarium really does need more, well, Apothecaries. The Companies we have should not be without! Especially on Aerus!<br/>
- In <b>012.M42</b>, 22 Gene-Seed should be available from the Test-Slaves.<br/>
<b>- Gracchus is currently studying the gene-seed of the Blood Ravens, to perhaps improve survival rates for implantation.</b><br/>

- I could use a few more peers in the forges. Or at least subordinates.<br/>
- Some of our most constant foes are the most numerous - orks, tyranids, the denizens of Chaos. Further firepower could surely assist, and one of the best examples of this are the Tarantula Turrets.<br/>
- We lost so many Tarantulas down on Aerus! We must replenish our numbers of those noble machines!<br/>
