Before you return to Laurelorn, you commission the making of a Dwarven axe to human dimensions, and arrange for it to be delivered upon completion to Baba Brzeginias of the village of Gerdouen. Her aid was a great help in dealing with the Gryphon Wood issue and bringing Kislev in to the Waystone Project, and though she likely did it in order to rid her forest of a dangerous interloper, that is no reason for ingratitude, especially if there is a possibility of needing to call on the knowledge and capabilities of the Hedgewise again in the future.

While your Gyrocarriage is refuelling at Barak Varr, you drop in on your bookseller contacts there and, on top of giving them a bag of Kislevite gold and telling them to turn it into Bretonnian books, you give them a list of the topics you have a less than exhaustive coverage of in your library and the titles you currently have in them and tell them that Karak Eight Peaks will pick up the bill for every new addition to that section, and will require only a modest discount for volume. From the thoughtful look in their eyes you're fairly sure they realize that this will represent quite an opportunity to clear out accumulated unsold inventory at almost full price, and you've no doubt that there'll be junior members of their Clan delving through every inch of their warehouses before long for materials they can offload into your growing library. While this may not be the most directed means of filling out your library, the sheer volume it should result in will be something to behold.

Turning your mind to the future as you board the Gyrocarriage once more, you're very aware that it has been two years since you began pursuing the Waystone Project, and though you're quite proud of having managed to bring in quite a diverse group of contributors, on paper you have nothing to show for it. And that begins to matter now that you have brought in four human contributors who do not have centuries of lifespan to wait, and who have responsibilities and ambitions of their own tugging at them. It will be very difficult to justify any further delays to the beginning of the Waystone Project, as any further recruitment you might make could very easily be countered by others withdrawing after years of no visible progress being made.



You have five action points (AP) you can apply without engaging in overwork. For every two AP spent across all members of WEB-MAT, including recruiting new members, you can spend one 'free' additional AP with any member of WEB-MAT. WEB-MAT actions are performed by Mathilde alongside that person when possible, such as studying something alongside that person, cowriting a paper together, one teaching the other, both of them learning something new, et cetera.
Current overwork status: [ ] [ ] [ ]
Each box will be filled by one action of overwork, and will take the two turns after that to fade as you recover. The first box incurs no penalty. The second will give a -10 penalty to all actions during the first turn of recovery. The third will give a -20 penalty to all actions on both turns of recovery.
Overwork incurs no penalties on the turns taken, only on the turns recovering from it. You can take as many actions of overwork as you have unfilled boxes.
When you use overwork it fills the left-most empty box, so [-][ ][ ] becomes [-][+][ ], not [+][-][ ]. All boxes recover in parallel and independent from one another, but second and third apply maluses on your actions during that cooldown period.

Kron-Azril-Ungol
Status: Built, unstaffed, not yet open to the general public.
The first AP spent in this category is free. Any additional choices cost 1 AP.
[ ] Decide who your library staff will consist of, and go about recruiting them. (NEW)
[ ] Go about recruiting an army of scribes so you can start copying entire libraries of material. (NEW) 
[ ] The many legends about the amount of books contained within and under Castle Drakenhof still haunt you. Organize an expedition to mine the ruins for books. (NEW) 
[ ] Seek the publishing contacts to start acquiring large amounts of books from a nearby realm (specify which: Bretonnia, Kislev, Tilea/Estalia, Araby)
Gives wide and easy access within a language, but is subject to local restrictions and is a less efficient use of the Library's acquisition budget than other methods.
[ ] Seek an exchange arrangement with another Library or a Karak's archives to be able to make copies of their corpus (specify which, eg: Great Library of Marienburg, Great Library of Altdorf, Ancient Library of Carroburg, Karaz-a-Karak Archives, Karak Vlag Archives)
Difficulty will depend on the size, prestige, and disposition of the library in question, and the relative impressiveness of Kron-Azril-Ungol.
[ ] Seek an agreement with a Cult to have access to their libraries (specify which, eg: Verenans, Myrmidians, Sigmarites)
Difficulty will vary heavily depending on the Cult in question, but can allow access to rare tomes and esoteric subjects.
[ ] Set up a no-questions-asked bounty system for books within the Cult of Ranald
Results will be unreliable and depending on what is sought may result in blowback, but this may allow you to acquire books that would otherwise be entirely inaccessible.


Ranald's Coin - specify which face it will be set to
[ ] The Gambler: specify an action this will apply to.
A +20 bonus to up to two dice rolls resulting from a single chosen action.
[ ] The Night Prowler
As long as you are outside of private property and within a town or city, nobody will question your presence and nobody will be able to find you if you do not wish them to.
[ ] The Deceiver: specify how this will be used.
Lies you have developed beforehand will be delivered perfectly. The listener may believe you to be mistaken, but they will never believe that you are lying. Cannot be used to tell truths.
[ ] The Protector
When you act in a way that defends an individual or group from a danger that you did not cause, they will become aware of what you have done and will believe you acted selflessly in doing so. Rule of thumb: if you have to explain why this might apply, it probably doesn't.
[ ] The Father
Ranald's daughters, and Their followers, will recognize you as being worthy of trust and faith.

You can literally write the book on a topic for the same amount of effort as two papers; this can be split over multiple turns. You don't need to have all the pieces to do so, but it would be more efficient and impressive if you did.

The Currency of Tylos
Coins of Nehekhara's Fourth Dynasty
Coins of Nehekhara's Sixth Dynasty





- There will be a eighteen hour moratorium. Voting will be in plan format.
- I've got a feeling I said 'remind me of X if I forget it' a lot more than I've added things. If so and you remember what X was, please speak up.
- This is about as loud a hint you're going to get that if you delay the Waystone Project any further, there may be consequences.
