Spoiler: Winning Vote



You commissioned a magical healing item: what spell is this based upon?
[X] Regrowth - Ghyran, instantly restores someone to full health from any state up to and including 'recently dead'. -9 College Favours

How will you present yourself to Belegar Ironhammer?
[X] As a representative of the Grey Order, here to lend a hand where it can be of most use.
[X] As a wanderer, not entirely sure what you seek.



You had expected some sort of enchanted jewellery; failing that, you supposed some sort of staff or rod. But when you visited the spiralling brick fortress of the Jade College, the Enchanter who had laboured over your commission had presented you with a single stylized seed carved from jade and inlaid with golden filigree.

"Hold out your non-casting hand," she said, and with trepidation you did, and she placed the seed upon your palm. Roots of unworked jade sprouted from the seed and plunged into the skin of your palm, and you flinched violently before you realize you felt no pain from the roots burying themselves in your flesh. "This power cannot be allowed to fall into any other hands," she said gravely as the seed was drawn below the skin, your flesh instantly scabbing over with bark and then the bark falling away to reveal unmarked flesh. She passed you a sheet of paper with a list of trigger mnemonics and their purpose. "It will trigger automatically should you be slain, or can be triggered with a mnemonic. A second mnemonic will use it to heal anyone you hold your palm to. It can hold four activations of power; to recharge, allow it to sprout in soil for three to eight hours per activation, depending on the richness of the soil - I recommend sleeping outdoors for this purpose. Alternately, when time is of the essence, hold your palm to an incapacitated or bound enemy and allow the roots to feed upon them. This will recharge a single activation. In a pinch, corpses can be used, albeit at a tenth of the effectiveness."

"Morbid," you commented distractedly as you committed the mnemonics to memory.

She nodded. "Death gives forth life."

She spent some time going over the technical details of how it worked, and you're glad to hear that it lies dormant and magically inactive when not triggered, and thus would not interfere with your own spellcasting. You thanked her sincerely; you had mustered every favour you had earned during your Journeywomanship and your graduation and expended them for this one artifact, but it still represented a great deal of invested time and effort on her part. She simply nodded once more, and wished you luck on your travels.

Those that would join the Throng of Belegar Ironhammer gather in the Dwarf Quarter of Grenzstadt, the fortress-town which protects the Empire side of the Black Fire Pass through the Black Mountains. Your rank gains you entrance to the town and a salute from the guards, and your name gets you a gruff nod of recognition from the guard on the entrance to the Dwarf Quarter. You're given directions to the tavern that has the honour of being the headquarters for the final preparations for the march on Karak Eight Peaks - Skratitrogg, which is translated for you as the Feasting Prospector.

Unlike the small scattered tables most human taverns favour, dwarf taverns favour long rectangular tables with benches. Belegar Ironhammer stands at the head of one of them, brooding over a collection of maps and papers and flanked by other dwarves. Unlike two of the others, his hair has not yet faded to white, and though his beard reaches to his knees its pale brown colour betrays his relative youth. The hammer he took his name from rests on the floor, its handle leaned against the table. According to legend, he swore an oath the day he came of age that he will reclaim Karak Eight Peaks or die in the attempt, and for the past sixty years has been gathering every scrap of support there was to be had. Now at ninety years of age, he is in the prime of his life and ready to finally fulfil his oath, one way or the other.

The dwarf to Belegar's left - the only other in the room with a beard not yet white with age - nudges him, and he turns to you. Though in this refuge he wears only the chain and scale of a dwarf's casual dress instead of the full plate and helmet he'd wear on the warpath, all that is visible of him beneath beard and hair and leather is a thin strip of face between moustache and eyebrows. The gaze that peers out at you beneath this is pale grey and calculating, taking the measure of you in an instant and weighing your potential as an asset or an obstacle to his life's mission of reconquest. "What brings you to this gathered throng?"

"I'm here to offer my services," you reply, and his eyebrows furrow.

"And on whose behalf?" he asks, his eyes boring into you.

"My own," you reply shortly, "as Dame Mathilde Weber, Magister of the Grey Order."

He stares at you a moment longer, then turns to the black-haired dwarf. "Ulthar, what's a Magister?"

The dwarf you presume to be Ulthar gives you a piercing look of his own. "She's a Master Mhornokri."

"Aye?" He looks at you again, respect in his eyes. "Then Clan Angrund welcomes you." He nods to the Longbeard on his right, aptly labelled, with a beard so long it trails the floor. "This is Halken Stonebeard, Eldest of Clan Angrund." And to his left, to the black-haired dwarf. "Ulthar Alriksson, Head Ranger and leader of the Karak Hirn forces." And across the table. "Skaroki Grimbrow, Thane of Karak Izor and leader of their forces."

"Well met," you greet them, receiving nods in return.

"So what brings you to this gathered throng?" he repeats.

You hesitate before answering. "I seek... well, I seek something to seek."

Ulthar grins at that, Halken frowns, and Belegar simply nods. "Strollendreki. Better a reason than most. Come, join the discussion." You approach the table, your scalp brushing against the roof, glad for once to be under-endowed with height. "You're not the first umgi zhufokri to join, there's a pair of Gorzhufokri, those animal wizards, and one of those damn strange Azulzhufokri metal wizards, but they're all Journeymanlings."

As you listen, he outlines the forces that have rallied to the Angrund banner. Karak Hirn in the Black Mountains and Karak Izor in the Vaults have both contributed Throngs, and Karak Kadrin has sent a small horde of slayers. On top of that there's a vast band of various dwarven glory-seekers, vagabonds, clanless dwarves and adventurers. In total, some forty thousand dwarves are gathered. That this is spoken of with great pride when it would barely match the meagre armed forces of Stirland speaks volumes of the state of the Dwarven Empire. At the core of it all is Clan Angrund itself: barely a thousand strong, but each armed with runic weapons and clad in rune-struck armour thanks to the contributions of the vaults of Karaz-a-Karak and the Master Runelord of Karak Azul.

On top of that, there are those that have answered the call just as you have. The most prominent of all, and a great surprise to you, is that two knightly orders have wordlessly rebuked the Empire as a whole and the Sigmarites especially by joining the campaign wholesale: the Knights of the Vengeful Sun, dedicated to Myrmidia, and the Knights of Taal's Fury, dedicated, of course, to Taal. Both are among the smallest of knightly orders, numbering just a cohort apiece, but both are extremely notable in that they are entirely mounted on demigryphs rather than horses.

Second of all and almost as surprising is the turnout from your home province: apparently the Elector Countess has started to phase out crossbows in favour of handguns and things have not been going well, as thousands of former troops have rallied to Clan Angrund to seek their fortunes rather than trying their luck with newfangled gunpowder contraptions. Of roughly equal size are the detachment of various hunters, poachers, and woodsmen from western and northern Stirland. A lifetime living next to Sylvania, you're sure, will make the Badlands seem homey by comparison.

The third major category of volunteers are, in a twist of irony, caused by the very breakdown in civil order that prevented the Empire proper from assisting. First, there are Nordlanders who have abandoned their home province in the face of entire villages disappearing overnight to seek their fortunes where the danger is something that can be met with an axe to the face. Many mistrust the Norscan blood running through Nordlander veins, but none can gainsay their ability in combat, and what they lack in armour or tactics they make up for in strength and courage. Second, bizarrely, an equal number of Middenlanders - religious exiles, apparently, who speak darkly of conflict within the Ulrican church. The core of this group are the Winter Wolves of Middenheim, who have struck the 'of Middenheim' from their name, turning their back on their home province as, they say, their home province has turned their back on them. Unusually for a knightly order, most of them fight dismounted, but a core of them are mounted on the giant wolves of the Drakwald. After a rocky start, the Nordlanders and Middenlanders have found common ground - both are disgusted with their respective provincial leadership, so they feel no need to continue the conflict.

Fourth, finally, and as unexpected as any, is the response from the Moot: they've sent the entire force that was present in the Sieges of the Drakenhofs as well as an equal amount of civilians, who boast the ability to produce a feast from damn near anything. If anything, it seems more like a migration than a military contribution.

Belegar gruffly concedes that though the Empire as an institution failed him, the turnout from the lands of man has made the trip worthwhile. All in all, it's a force of near a hundred thousand that gathers. Though only time will tell how many remain when you finally reach Karak Eight Peaks, or how many will survive the assault on it.

He extends to you an offer to sit on his War Council, such as it is. The other members thus far are the three other dwarves that were introduced to you: the Grand Master of one of the demigryph orders to speak for both, the Grand Master of the Winter Wolves to speak on behalf of the combined Nordlander and Middenlander forces, and the Marshal leading the Halflings. The exact position you'll be filling is left unclear - you could be joining merely as a Magister in your own right, or as the most senior Wizard of all those present. It would even be possible to slip into command of the Stirlander forces - you commanded them once, you're sure you could do so again, if you desire.


Do you wish to sit on the War Council, and if so, as what?
[ ] Accept as leader of the Stirlander forces (commanding 5,000 crossbowmen and 5,000 huntsmen).
[ ] Accept as the most senior Wizard present (commanding two Amber Journeymen and one Gold Journeyman).
[ ] Accept simply as yourself.
[ ] Decline.


There is time before the assembled horde sets off; how do you wish to spend this time? The three with the most votes from the below two categories will be chosen.

Spending time with and getting to know:
[ ] Ulthar Alriksson, Head Ranger
[ ] Skaroki Grimbrow, Thane
[ ] The Amber Wizard journeymen.
[ ] The Gold Wizard journeyman.
[ ] The Stirlander forces
[ ] The Halfling forces
[ ] The Demigryph Knights
[ ] The Winter Wolves

Other Pursuits:
[ ] Spend time with your wolf pup, trying to develop a famliar bond.
[ ] Deliver last-minute messages for Belegar, trying to scrape together any remaining support to be had before leaving.
- [ ] To Elector Counts.
- [ ] To mercenaries.
- [ ] To the Colleges of Magic.
- [ ] To Knightly Orders.
- [ ] To Dwarfholds of the Grey and Black Mountains.
