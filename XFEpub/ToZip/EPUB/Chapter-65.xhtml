[*] Continue to supervise the dispelling lessons.
[*] Volunteer to ride ahead and scout this long-lost port.
[*] Work with them to see if your eggs can be encouraged to hatch.



What Esbern lacks in magical vocabulary, he makes up for in shared experience with Seija. You're able to correct a number of assumptions the two of them have made and give them the proper terminology for what they're talking about, but their grasp of the fundamentals is quite solid and they communicate it well. Another couple of days of spare moments snatched between meals, marching and sleep is sufficient to fill in the gaps in Seija's knowledge, and by the time you leave the two of them her Ghur is quite able to gnaw away at magical formations. Not the most riveting way to spend a couple of days, but you've a feeling that soon enough you'll need all the dispelling manpower - even if it is only journeymanpower - you can get your hands on.

In the breaks taken from dispelling lessons, the two Amber Mages turn their attention to the eggs you bought in Barak Varr.

"Bird or reptile?" Esbern asks thoughtfully.

"Reptile. Lustrian, allegedly."

Esbern frowns. "Ah. Reptiles are something of an acquired taste."

Seija shakes her head. "Life is life, beasts are beasts." She picks one of them up and concentrates intently. "Some eggs hatch or die. Some eggs wait until conditions are appropriate. We shall see."

She stands transfixed by the egg until you're wondering if something's wrong, but Esbern looks unworried. "Life in an egg, if it has not grown beyond fertilization, is barely life at all," he explains. "Concentration can be required." You accept that with a shrug, and summon Wolf with a whistle to entertain you while you wait.

[Seija's communing with the egg: 81]

Finally, after over an hour, she stirs, suddenly thrusting the egg into Esbern's waiting hands with a shiver - a shiver of cold, rather than of horror, thankfully. "Too cold," she says. "Alive, but waiting for heat." She rubs her arms as she shifts from foot to foot. "Carnivore," she confirms. "Not apex. Not especially intelligent, but sharp senses."

The rest of the process of discovery is agonizingly slow, as the egg's temperature is changed while Seija communes with it, seeking to discover a preferred range. In the end, though, you have all the information you need to begin the growth of the eggs, though Seija says they've still barely begun growing so it will take some weeks.

When you volunteered to ride ahead, Belegar was sceptical until you told him your ability to make the 400-mile round trip in two to three days. Then he's all for it, and gives you the approximate location of the port and the relative location of the entrance to the Underways. With a copy of the map in hand, you leave Wolf with Esbern and Seija and set off along the north bank of the Blood River.

The first leg of the trip is simple - a force has already blazed the trail to have a bridge ready by the time the bulk of the Expedition arrives, and Ulthar and Petrescu's scouts are sweeping the area regularly. It's not until you reach the under-construction bridge, carefully cross the rickety wooden bridge that was built for tools and workers to cross to build the proper bridge, and go beyond those standing guard that you're truly ranging into enemy territory. Most maps would claim that this is still part of the Border Princes, but between the Ironclaw Orcs of the Iron Rock and the Night Goblins of Thunder Mountain, there's no Border Prince foolish enough to lay claim to the area.

[Venturing into the unknown: 4]
[Rolling for enemy...]
[Who spots who? 39 vs 21]

The land has been steadily rising and growing more and more treacherous as you ascend into the foothills of the World's Edge Mountains, the scant soil and hardy shrubs starting to give way to rock and no vegetation at all. There's a whiff of sulphur in the air, and the source is obvious: Thunder Mountain dominates the horizon, forever spewing smoke into the air.

It's because you were so captivated by the sight of the restless volcano that you caught sight of the creature before it of you; making its way along the hills between you and Thunder Mountain with footing as steady as your own shadowsteed, it resembles a centaur, but far too big even for those terrible creatures. Instead of a combination of a man and a horse, this seems to have the top half of an ogre and the bottom half of a dragon.

[Knowledge roll: Knowledge, Req 70, 61+20=81]

Someone with no knowledge of the creature is likely to stumble over its name by sheer accident, but you've read accounts of the Great War Against Chaos. Though most of your attention was reserved for the legalization of magic and the founding of the Colleges, you did read of the terrible chaos creatures that poured into the Empire as part of the horde of Asavar Kul. This is a Dragon Ogre - a member of an ancient race that, according to legend, gave themselves over to Chaos to avoid extinction, and now can die only in battle. They renew themselves atop mountain peaks during the most terrible of storms, and in doing so can live and grow indefinitely.

The habits of these creatures when they aren't despoiling the realms of man are little known. Does this creature live a solitary life, is he currently hunting for food? Given the massive axe he wields, it seems that if he's hunting, it's for goblin or orc rather than goat. Is he migrating from one mountain to another, seeking a higher peak to await the rejuvenating storms it relies upon? Or is it worse than that: is he a scout for a larger force of his horrible kin?

The creature moves swiftly, his taloned feet digging into sheer surfaces and propelling him up slopes that would give a goat pause. It won't be long until he's out of sight, and considering his speed and how jagged the terrain is, you don't like your chances of finding him again once lost. You must choose quickly how you'll react to this unexpected interloper.

[ ] If he's a scout, he cannot be allowed to live and alert some unknown number of his kin to the Expedition. Attack.
[ ] You don't know enough to make a decision one way or the other. Follow the creature and see if its actions shed light on its purpose.
[ ] Turn back and alert the Expedition to the creature, and the possibility of more.
[ ] Ignore the creature and press on. You've a port to scout.
[ ] Other (write in)

- His current course leads away from the path of the expedition, but there's no guarantee he'll stick to it.
