Gabriel was silent for but five seconds. Tactical considerations flowed, scenarios crashing and breaking against one another. On the intermittent flickering of the tactical display, his eyes carefully studied each oncoming ork ship. Individually weak, mighty in a swarm. Words fit for greenskins, tyranids, and many xenos besides. Each ship the Blood Ravens had was precious, far harder to replace compared to the Imperial Navy. The space marines within those ships, perhaps even more so. And yet, the threat before them might require every brother, every Blood Raven there was. It was their purpose. There was no hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
“Advance, Brother-Captain. Bring us to their precious stronghold. Go through them, if you must.”<br/>
<br/>
The Chapter Master did not turn to see the expression of mild bemusement that flickered across Hadrian’s face. Upon the command throne, the Master of the Fleet transferred the orders across the entire fleet. Reactors heaved and engines shuddered as nearly the entire Blood Raven chapter fleet in totality closed ranks. Dangerously close, even, with only the advanced cogitators of the ships and the skill of their space marine and serf captains keeping them from disaster. Larger than them all, the battle barges became a massive bident head, whole hammers rather than spikes, and as one, they roared forward into the void.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well then. All ships! Advance at full power to forward void shields and engines!”<br/>
<br/>
The orks, as was their alien wont, did not hesitate either. All they saw was a bounty of scrap and electronics for their meks to tear apart and build back up. All they saw was a fight waiting for them, and one they were more than eager enough to oblige. The ork swarm of ships activated their own engines, expending ludicrous amounts of ammo despite obviously being out of effective range. To the shock of some junior crewmen, especially those newly trained and then established upon some of the newer Blood Raven ships, the orks began to accelerate. What void shields the ork ships possessed, or at least their strange equivalents, flickered in a static filled aurora of copper and greenish light as even more of their power were redirected to their own engines and weaponry.<br/>
<br/>
(Driving Forward: 89 vs. 38)<br/>
<br/>
Void-borne leviathans of adamantium and fury plunged into the oncoming storm.<br/>
<br/>
And the storm was broken in turn.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>Omnis Arcanum </i>plowed through three different brute ram ships, its armored prow thicker and stronger than all three combined. They shattered against its shields and its layered hull, their weapons fire barely acknowledged pinpricks by the old ships venerable machine spirit. On the other side, the <i>Scientia Est Potentia </i>performed a similar maneuver against another grouping of other ram ships. Weapons fired continuously from the ships of the Blood Ravens, lesser in number than the weapons opposing them significantly but far more accurate. Macro batteries fired and tore apart the comparatively weaker and in some cases total lack of armor on the oncoming ships. The <i>Legacy of Polonius </i>tore apart an onrushing onslaught attack vessel, firing the equivalent fire of three Imperial escort ships all at once from its prow. A series of stabbing lance shots cored it, sending it tumbling into a dozen pieces where extended ammo magazines cooked off in silent explosions in the void.<br/>
<br/>
But there were yet many more ork ships, ever more it seemed in the darkening galaxy of late. And though the Blood Ravens had destroyed a surprising number with their forward momentum, the orks were among them now.<br/>
<br/>
(Pushing Through Defense Swarm: 54 vs. 92)<br/>
<br/>
And the fighting was fierce. Though the escort ships and the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company had followed in the violent wake of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> and 4<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company fleets, they were no strangers to battle. Briefly and repeatedly there were miniature firestorms. Weapons batteries fired and fired, on both sides. Orks cackled and snarled as they eagerly attempted to slam their ships into those of their foes. In two dire cases, they succeeded, cracking a gladius of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company nearly in half. The <i>Burning Seeker</i> was slammed into from two directions, sending it into a horizontal corkscrew at the hands of two different brute ram ships. Though it eventually managed to right itself, damage to the weapon arrays and engines forced it into a slowed posture. Teleporting cybork boarders – so nearly completely mechanical they appeared to be xenos servitors more than anything else – managed to flash their way briefly into existence onto the <i>Spiraling Fury</i> before the attendant 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company marines managed to kill them all. Dozens of serfs were killed, as well as a smattering of servitors, beforehand however.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the Blood Ravens charged on. And the orks, so eager to fight, bellowed and browbeat their crews to turn their ships despite the sheer acceleration already pushed onto straining ramshackle frames.<br/>

(Exiting The Defense Swarm: 33 vs. 46)<br/>
<br/>
“We are taking increased fire from the ork planetoid,” Hadrian shouted, face locked into the rictus grimace of one struggling to move and command an entire fleet at once. “Void shields holding amongst front-running ships!”<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel had not yet even moved from where he stood, the weight of his body enough to keep him anchored even if he had not placed his hands upon the edges of the tactical screen. The <i>Omnis Arcanum</i> barreled on, its bombardment cannons already firing upon the target before them. Frustratingly, if expected, were the sudden blooms of wildly flickering ork shields upon the thing. From various haphazard pylons and things appearing as if ancient terran tesla coils, large crackling streams of lightning which terminated in wide umbrellas of protective energies. The other battle barge and lead ships of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> and 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Fleet were doing the same. That the foe was reaching such a mass was, hopefully, something that could be used against them.<br/>
<br/>
If they hadn’t piled on so many damned <i>shields</i> to keep the deadliest munitions from finding purchase. It was not lightly that one could consider the usage of Exterminatus munitions. Especially for one such as Gabriel Angelos. The burnt cinders of Cyrene would forever glow as regretful embers in his soul. The ghosts of his homeworld would remain, no matter how many battles he fought or how old he might become. Brighter, more recent, were the failures of the whole Chapter at Typhon, which hung on his shoulders in a way that was both familiar and foreign to him. But as the Chapter Master, he was to shoulder them all the same. Forever. But this? An ork base, hurtling through the void, capable of building its own ships?<br/>
<br/>
No. There was no guilt to be had at unleashing such weaponry on something such as <i>this</i>.<br/>

(Reaching The Station: 47 vs. 7)<br/>
<br/>
“We’re through,” Hadrian said through grit teeth.<br/>
<br/>
And so the Blood Ravens were. The rest of the ork ships took further damage as they were attacked from the sides and rear, even as they worked to turn about. There were ever fewer guns on such vessels the further one went from the front, to the point that the final third of almost any ork ship was entirely bereft. The only thing to find there would be engines, engines, and even more engines. Engines which were being crippled even now. Thunderhawks flew flight after flight, unleashing bombs and missile fire which tore apart the vulnerable ork engines. The maneuverability of the xenos ships, already lackluster compared to the ships of the Imperium, suffered even further. Ponderously, furiously, they began to turn.<br/>
<br/>
But by then, the Blood Ravens were entirely past them.<br/>
<br/>
Into the waiting weapons fire of the so-called ‘Doom-Eater’.<br/>
<br/>
As well as something else.<br/>
<br/>
From all three of its strange affixed assembly piles, blasted off three brand new ork ships. These were not of the same tonnage as the effective escorts left behind. No, even as they blipped into being on the tactical display, their signatures growing more and more distinct as they left the station behind them, Gabriel knew what they were. As did Hadrian.<br/>
<br/>
“Three kill kroozers, on approach!” Hadrian called out to his crew, servitors at their stations suddenly beginning to nearly frenzy at their consoles. More quietly, Hadrian muttered to himself at a volume such that only Gabriel and Apollo, who stood waiting nearby, could have heard him.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that was when the vox squealed again and the guttural roar of the ork’s leader was flooding the surrounding air space in every direction on every possible channel.<br/>
<br/>
“Daahahaaa, you didn’t fink it wud be dat easy, did ya, pinky boyz?!”<br/>
<br/>
The jaws of the ‘Doom-Eater’, previously having slammed shut, began to open once more. This time, rather than devouring anything at all, a new series of contacts upon the tactical screen began to pour outwards. An ugly drool of scrap metal ships and ramshackle assortment escaping a god’s rusted teeth. The cogitators identified them as a second, if smaller, swarm of ork ships similar to the ones that had just been left behind. All the while the long range guns of the monstrous station before them belched primitive lance fire, accompanied by cloudy thick missiles and massed battery fire. All danced across the void shields of the Blood Ravens, straining the shields of some ships while barely getting a blink out of others.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve seen a lotta things since coming from da Big Dark, chasing da sound of da WAAAAGH!! You weird ‘umie’ fings, yer weird orks, and dem squiggly rippy fings what etted Warboss Star-Stompa’s big fleet!”<br/>
<br/>
The ships advanced on, locked into their respective courses.<br/>
<br/>
“Ya shouldn’t underestimate Da Doom-Eater!!”<br/>
<br/>
(Phase Clash Terminus: 4 vs. 99)<br/>
<br/>
One of the kroozers suddenly lit up as the auspex sent out dozens of rapid-fire warnings. The warp screamed, and it disappeared, only to reappear in the middle of one of the nova frigates of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company. The frigate was torn apart into a tremendous amount of component pieces, while the kroozer itself which had done the deed erupted soon after, causing damage to the ships in the surrounding area. The new oncoming fleet split into two, and the battle barge of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company was soon heavily impacted as a multitude of ramships popped its void shields like so many bubbles. Immediately ork boarders began flooding in, either through crude boarding torpedoes or risking the warp itself to teleport in. The second of the kroozers simply charged in before essentially deflating as ork bombers and fighters came tearing out of its metal flesh. The gunships that contested them took down dozens, each, but many were eventually overwhelmed. The fighting grew fiercer, the machine spirit of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i> beginning to rumble out of displeasure at the goings on, despite the best efforts of the techmarines. Another gladius went down, this time one of the 1st Company's while the <i>Legacy of Polonius</i>' prow lance was turned to near slag. It was a harsh price to pay, in the final stretch, but eventually all the ships that could make it, did.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Ravens fleet hung in the void above 'Da Doom-Eater', which was already beginning to open up with heavier closer-range weaponry. Primitive plasma bombs, heavier caliber weaponry that could actually harm battle barge hulls, all of these began to open up. Pockmarks in the various energy shields of the ork station began to pepper open to allow such munitions to fire freely without issue.<br/>
<br/>
"We've arrived, Chapter Master," Hadrian called out, even as he directed the void battle to the best of his abilities. "Your orders to the Chapter?!"<br/>

<i>Note: Remember to note if you want a hero unit to deploy, i.e. a Captain/Apollo/Justinius/Gabriel/Etc. It is possible that without Hadrian directing the void fighting that the Blood Raven ships might suffer some difficulty. <br/>
Note 2: Also remember that the 10th Company currently has many un-assigned battle brothers currently bearing their crest.</i><br/>
<b>[] Board And Pull Back:</b> The amount of firepower being thrown towards the fleet is enough that even the venerable battle barges are feeling the strain. If the ships were to remain for too long, they could begin taking unrecoverable damage. Especially with the ork ships coming to surround the fleet from two different directions. Get as many battle brothers down as can be done and let them do the work of sabotaging the structure's defenses so that the ships can return in somewhat more safety. However, some battle brothers should likely stay on the ships to help prevent boarding, which the orks are certainly already attempting and in some cases succeeding to do! Either way, it would be simple for the fleets to reach a distance where the station's defenses are incapable of causing any harm, and if the Blood Raven ships were to focus on destroying the ork fleet, they would be far more deadly than simply trying to push past. (Write-In Number Of Space Marines To Deploy To Planetoid/How Many Remain On-Fleet For Defensive Purposes. Or just do one and I'll assume all those not mentioned stay.)<br/>
<b>[] Board And Hold</b>: The firepower is extreme. The need to remain is as well. Orbital fire, the bombardment cannons, and assistance from the thunderhawks cannot be understated. Without auspex support either, the troops will have far less intelligence and ability to act accurately and surely. Board as many battle brothers as possible onto the station, holding back others for defensive purposes. The thunderhawks will likely take a heavy toll in defense of the ships, but it will hopefully be sacrifices well made. The minute an ork energy shield goes down, your ships can target the vulnerable area and begin cracking this place open further. All that is needed is a chance, and the sooner the better. The sheer defenses of the Blood Raven ships will have to be enough. Holding on until bombardment is possible is a Codex approved tactic, and one that has been used by practically every space marine chapter since the Codex was even established.

<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
<b>[] Invasion Targets: </b>It is a dire question. Where should the marines head to as they board the Doom-Eater? Try to find its bellowing master and put an end to this immediately? Set aflame the construction yards so no more new ships can enter the battle? The defensive guns which are in danger of killing the Blood Raven fleet? The energy shields which are preventing the fleet from bombarding this place into dust? A dire question indeed. One that must be answered. Now.

OR<br/>
<br/>
<b>[] Pull Back</b>: Now that you are here, you are in danger of being destroyed. The orks could be making even more ships inside of this thing, and there is still the missing raiding fleet(s) to consider. You know far more than you did before, and it may be time to make a tactical retreat. You have identified the enemy, its various characteristics, and have taken numerous detailed auspex scans. The Imperial Navy could likely do the job without you at this point. You have already taken considerable damage, and you only ever have so many ships in the Chapter Fleet. <b>Engagement Ends, Fleet Retreats As Best As Possible</b></div>
