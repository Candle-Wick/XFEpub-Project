    <h2>Character Creation - Part 4</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">Forty years ago, in the year 2430, the Elector Count of Stirland and Emperor of the Empire of Man, Dieter IV, brought the Empire to the brink of ruin, culminating in selling Marienburg its independence and ending in his being deposed. With the former Emperor and his accursed family, the Unf√§higer, retreating to Talabecland to consolidate power there, rule of Stirland passed uncontested to the ill-fated Haupt-Anderssen dynasty. Though seemingly sober and worthy rulers, they appeared cursed with ill fortune, rule of the province passing from hand to hand as apparent natural causes took one ruler after another. Finally, at the end of the year 2469, the last Haupt-Anderssen held the title - the eighth of his line to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Then he, too, was gone.<br/>
<br/>
In a shroud of great secrecy, the Elector Count Alberich II Haupt-Anderssen was declared dead, and the eastern wing of the palace was sealed off. An emergency meeting of the Electer Counts was called to decide who next would take up the Runefang of Stirland.<br/>
<br/>
Far away in the city of Altdorf, fourteen Electors met. Many messengers came in and out of the chambers they were ensconced within. Those messengers spurred other messengers, which spurred more still. And eventually, a letter is delivered to your normally taciturn Master in the middle of breakfast that causes his eyebrows to shoot towards his hairline.<br/>
<br/>
By lunch, you were atop a conjured horse with a new set of robes and a letter of introduction, ordered to ride to Stirland where you were to serve as the Spymaster of the new Elector Count. You knew that, having reached the rank of Journeyman, you were to be sent out into the world to prove yourself, but the abruptness of it took your breath away - and the letter tucked into your pocket that you were sternly instructed not to read until you had arrived and were in private filled you with suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
You were trained as a Grey Wizard, after all. It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.<br/>
