    <h2>The March to Karak Eight Peaks - Week 4 - The Road to Barak Varr</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[*] Rangers appreciate an anticlimactic victory. Enchant a spider-horn for them to commemorate it. (+rep)
[*] Now that you know (well, remember) a little more, a certain suspicion is growing. Pin him down and ask his intentions regarding Skaven technology.
[*] King Belegar Ironhammer



The King of Karak Eight Peaks does not ride - he marches with his Clan. It is at the end of a day's march that you find him slowly turning a spit of meat over a fire that, on closer inspection, turns out to be the leg of an enormous spider. You politely decline as he offers you some.

"Heard more about you since you joined," he says thoughtfully. "The business in the land of the Vampires. Neat bit of work, that."

"It needed doing," you say simply.

He nods. "There's a lot that does, and yet so precious few that do. Even among my folk." He sighs. "All speak of the importance of keeping to the old ways, yet those that do are the ones that help the least. Nine dwarves in ten that answered my call to arms are from Holds that were mere outposts during the Time of Woes, and outnumbering even them are the manlings. By Grimnir's beard, even with Kragg counting for five I'd have more wizards than Runepriests!" He sighs. "No offence to your lot, but my ancestors needed no Wizards."

"Nor did they need gunpowder, yet I see no tugging of beards over handguns and cannon."

Unexpectedly, he chuckles. "You've got me there, young Zhufokri. I've oft wondered if things would be different, had we dwarves discovered the power of blackpowder three centuries earlier and been able to use it in the defence of my Karak."

You nod. "I think the same, sometimes. We humans have only allowed and trained Zhufokri for one hundred and seventy-four years, and there's no telling how many historical events we could have tipped the scales at."

He pulls the spit out of the fire and gives it a cautious sniff. "Well, here's to progress," he says, pulling a chunk of flesh out of the cracked carapace and popping it into his mouth. He grimaces at the taste, but it doesn't stop him from reaching for more.

Rangers, more than most dwarves, value efficiently mass-produced death over finely-crafted artisan slaughter. An idea occurs to you for capitalizing on the fortunate chain of events that routed the goblins before they could even begin their attack: the creation of a horn commemorating the vicotry.

As before, enchantment is normally a long process, so to cut it down to a couple of days means sacrifices need to be made. This time you can't sacrifice permanence without countering the entire point of the item, so the intended effect needs to be reduced. A pitch-perfect horn that blows well no matter how weak the breath of the blower; a suitable commemoration, you decide, and it should only take a few days. You fold Ulgu into enchanting tools and begin.

[Enchanting: Learning, 6+20=26]

Two days later, the unearthly caterwauling coming from your creation comes to an ignominious end with you shattering it with a hammer. Perhaps you made it far too sensitive, as the slightest breeze or the merest movement would set off the hornblow, which struggled to hold a constant note with so variable an origin. Perhaps there was no way around this without making the horn require a blower instead of wind, but sensing the difference would have taken even longer to enchant into the item. When you emerge from your tent, you're getting an awful look of nervous looks. You fight back a scowl, and decide to lay low over the next few days.

You find Johann at an isolated end of the most recent campsite, practising his firing drill into the side of a hill. Knowing how rude it would be to interrupt someone's martial training, you watch as he loads and fires with slightly clumsy motions. Unlike the muzzle-loading handguns used in the Empire, the dwarven handgun he has somehow gotten his hands on loads from the base of the barrel. It seems to be a much more efficient design for reloading - he sends six rounds downrange in a minute with an obviously untrained hand, where an expert with an Empire handgun could just about manage four.

"Fantastic devices," he says over his shoulder to you as the echo of the last shot fades from your ears. "We could learn much from the dwarves."

"I agree," you say, "But we could earn a terrible enemy in the process, if they object to the learning."

"Ah," he says, as he peers down the barrel to check for blockages. "Is that what you're worried about?"

You glance around to make sure none are in range to overhear. "Your spells are tailored for it, and none of the alternatives are good. There are three possible targets for you at Karak Eight Peaks: one are our allies, one who are not known for technology, and one who are not known, period."

He gives you a calculating look. "I could have sworn you didn't know. Bloody Grey Mages." He slings the handgun over his shoulder. "Look, the ratmen are hideously gifted at technological artifice," he says. "Much of it incorporates wyrdstone, and I intend to find out whether it's fully reliant on it or just uses it for a power boost or to blunt-force past shoddy construction. If the underlying premise of their weaponry is sound, then it can be adapted for use with the proper Winds of Magic, or ideally, for entirely non-magical gun crews."

"And if it is entirely reliant on wyrdstone?"

He raises his hands. "That would be useful information to take back to the Gold Order, and it would end our study of Skaven machinery. We've no desire to breach Article Seven."

"And your time with the dwarves?"

"I like dwarves." You give him a flat look, and he smiles. "That truly is the sole reason. If I earn enough favour during this expedition that they give me another secret or two to take home of their own free will, then so be it, but I'm not going to endangering the oldest and truest alliance we have to learn how to make slightly better cannon."

You give him a searching look, and he smiles back at you. He seems to be telling the truth, but he also seems to be glib enough that if he was lying you might not catch it. "Very well," you say reluctantly. "Just make sure your dealings with the dwarves are all above board."

"Of course. Will that be all, Magister?"

"For now." You watch as he turns away and resumes his firing drill once more.

As you approach Barak Varr, the only indication that you actually are doing so is the rising frequency of their patrols that pass and the excitement of the dwarves you journey with. As far as you can tell, the gently rising slope continue until it plunges off a cliff face into the sea. It is only when the rise is circled around to the edge of the Black Gulf that Barak Varr becomes visible, dug into the enormous cave the tides have dug into the Varenka Hills.





Barak Varr is the trading center of the Dwarven Empire. Roads and rivers through the Border Princes link it to Karaz-a-Karak, to Karak Hirn, to Zhufbar, to Karak Izor. Human traders disembark goods here to travel overland to the Empire rather than risking the dangers of the Sea of Claws to sail to Marienburg and the rivers of the Empire. By land, expeditions set out through the three mountain passes - the Silver Road, held by the dwarves, Mad Dog Pass, held by the Border Princes, and Death Pass, held by the greenskins - to make the long overland voyage through the Dark Lands. Their destination can be the Dragon Isles, or Ind, or Cathay, and in any of which they can find silk and spices and precious stones enough to make vast fortunes equal to the dangers of the trip.

Belegar unexpectedly declares that the expedition will call Barak Varr home for the next week as he enters talks with the King of Barak Varr, Byrrnoth Grundadrakk.

Between Barak Varr's runepriests and the presence of Kragg the Grim, this is the time to commission a runic item if ever there was one. Will you?
[ ] Yes
[ ] No

Also choose how many favours you'll invest, in what sort of item, and in broad strokes what the purpose will be. Even if you vote [ ] No, you can vote on what the item would be should [ ] Yes win. Because of Kragg's presence, there is no maximum amount of favours that can be invested in a single item.

---

As you are staying put instead of on the march, the top FIVE actions will be chosen; four if runic item is commissioned.

Contributing to the Campaign:
[ ] For the sake of your curiosity, sit in on some of the meetings between the two Kings.
[ ] Have Ulthar handpick his best sharpshooters to be equipped with envenomed bolts.
[ ] Many mercenaries look for work at Barak Varr among trades looking to make the long and dangerous trip to the east. See if any can be convinced to join the Expedition instead.


Spend time with the Council of War:
[ ] Master Runelord Kragg the Grim (?)
[ ] Thane Skaroki Grimbrow
[ ] Master Engineer Durin Wutokri
[ ] Grand Master Sigwald Kriegersen
[ ] Grand Master Ruprecht Wulfhart
[ ] Marksman Codrin Petrescu
[ ] Marshal Titus Muggins


Other Preparations:
[ ] You've heard that greatswords and greataxes are very similar in the way they're used, and you happen to be surrounded by experts in the art of the axe. Learn how to use one.
[ ] Barak Varr is one of the greatest centers of trade in the world. Spend some time browsing to see if you find anything interesting.


Spend time with your Journeymanlings:

Esbern and Seija of the Amber Order
[ ] Test their skills in battle by sparring with them.
[ ] Have them help you teach your fast-growing familiar simple commands.
[ ] Help Seija teach Esbern to Dispel.

Panoramia of the Jade Order
[ ] Barak Varr is a trading hub; go shopping with her and employ your good name among dwarves to see if there's seeds of anything useful to be found.
[ ] The Black Lotus is a valuable trade good for those that encounter large and terrible beasts. Assist her in growing and selling some while you're here.

Maximilian de Gaynesford of the Gold Order
[ ] Ask him to reforge your sword into a superior one.
[ ] Introduce him to the dwarven smiths so he can try to convince them to teach him.
[ ] Ask the smiths to teach him as a favour to you (-2 favours)
[ ] Ask him to teach Johann to Dispel.

Johann of the Gold Order
[ ] Help him find a place with the dwarf artillery crews so that he can supplement their abilities in combat.
[ ] Keep tabs on his interactions with the dwarves, making sure he's not fishing for information that the dwarves want to keep for themselves.
[ ] Dwarf technology may be off limits, but the technology of other races are not and there could be all sorts of useful gadgets coming in from overseas. See if you can pick anything useful up with him from the vast markets of Barak Varr.


- If there's anything else you'd like to get up to in Barak Varr, let me know and I'll add it to the list.
- It is possible to enchant firearms, but the effects will be significantly less for the same amount of favours due to the difficulty and the relative newness of that type of weapon.
- It is possible to have the dwarves make a staff for you; this will not have the benefits of an increase to magic that a 'normal' staff would have, but it would allow them more 'room' to work with and thus will let them squeeze more in for the same amount of favours.
- It is possible for the Dwarves to make a magical banner for you, featuring your Coat of Arms. These generally have protective effects that extend to both the carrier and nearby allies.
- A runic axe or hammer will have slightly more power than a runic sword, due to the time spent grumbling over having to work on an improper Umgi weapon.
- Giving dwarves a general direction to go in, like making a weapon better at killing or making a talisman for protection, will have stronger results than trying to micromanage the exact effect of the runes.
- To put it another way: Exchanging favours for a magic item isn't the same as walking into a shop and commissioning something with good solid gold. It's indicating with subtlety and tact that you would be appreciative of an artifact of a certain type, and the dwarves take the hint and something is created to reward you for the good you have done for the dwarven people. As such, the less you specify, the more room they have for their imaginations (and mine!) to be fired up by the task and for them to create a magical wonder.
