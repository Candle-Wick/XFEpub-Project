    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: Victory at the East Gates</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[*] Seek and slay bosses and other important targets among the fleeing greenskins



Karak Eight Peaks has been breeding a wide assortment of foulness for three thousand years. You could spend the next decade cutting down rank and file without making an appreciable dent in their numbers. This battle will be carried by doubling down on Belegar's decapitation strike, and you resolve to bring death to the least replaceable parts of this infinitely replaceable horde: leaders, specialists, spellcasters, and anything else unfortunate enough to catch your eye.

Your hand tightens on the hilt of your greatsword as you survey the breaking horde. To mundane eyes, the tumult of battle is a confused mess of panicking greenskins, but your own sight is not so limited. You can see the confusion of battle as it clouds the minds of the scattering creatures, and with it you seek out those that show up the least to your supernatural senses. One such target presents itself, and you're moving towards it before your senses have time to analyse it beyond it being an island of purpose in a sea of confusion.

[Spotting leaders: Martial, 21+19=40.]
[Seeking a lack of confusion: Learning, 33+20=53.]
[Rolling for foe...]

It's big. Not quite as big as the Warboss that Belegar just dispatched, and lacking in the darkest-green shade of black that characterized its kind, but still massive enough that his eyes are near level with yours, despite your mount. Big enough that a slight flicker of doubt manages to voice some misgivings before the rest of you mercilessly crushes it. And it's not only your mundane senses causing alarm, because his hands are filled not with the crude iron weaponry so many of his fellows sport, but with a staff made of gnawed bones lashed together with rotting sinew. As his eyes meet yours, his foul mouth swings open and he roars a wordless challenge, the ever unchanging battlecry of the orcs: Waaagh!

Orc magic, you have a fraction of a second to consider, is unlike anything you've previously encountered. All the revulsion of Dhar with none of the temptation. All the alienness of holy energies with none of the familiarity of human gods. Energy crackles off every orc nearby as it is drawn into the creature as it gathers the brutal power of the Waaagh into itself, forming the bizarre magical energies into a crude but powerful weapon.

[Orc magic: 66+15(Shaman skill)+10(Waagh Energies)-30(Terrified Orcs)=61.]
[Countermagic: Learning, 58+20=78.]

Unfortunately for the shaman, the time you spent in Sylvania has made you keenly aware of the dangers of blending magics. And among the Waaagh energies the shaman has been siphoning from its fleeing fellows, it has also gathered into itself the loss and confusion they are enveloped by. And the name of those energies is Ulgu. You extend your will, and in an instant a fraction of the power the shaman is trying to wield is rebelling against him, threatening to tear away his control of the spell. Any mage taught by the Colleges of Magic knows how to react in this situation: release the spell, ground the energies, and pray.

Orcs, it seems, have a different strategy.

His warcry devolves into a wordless bellow of rage and frustration as he redoubles his efforts, and the Waaagh energies turn inward as he focuses his efforts on purging his spell of this alien magic that refuses to obey. His willpower is considerable, and the energies he wields are considerable, supplemented by the groupmind of the Waaagh that connects the beasts to their terrible gods. The magical energies wrap around the Ulgu and clamp down with terrible power, and for a second triumph shows in his terrible, hateful eyes.

Perhaps he sees the same triumph in yours, before he realizes how futile it is to close one's metaphorical fist around a handful of fog.

Scattered across the battlefield, five wizards wince and one Runelord smiles. The magnitude of how badly the shaman has fumbled shines like a second sun for those with the senses to see, and reality itself shudders in protest as chaos takes possession of the energies it birthed. The orc screams as the energies implode inwards, forming a singularity of rebellious energies in the center of his undoubtedly minuscule brain, and every muscle in his body locks as alien energies rampage through orcish nerves.

You reach the orc before gravity takes hold. You wonder if you are performing a mercy, as your sword shears through the shaman's neck.

[Orc doubles down on casting: 24+15(Shaman skill)=39.]
[Countermagic: Learning, 79+20+20(Ulgu assists)=119.]
[Rolling for miscast...]

[Spotting leaders: Martial, 60+19=79.]
[Seeking a lack of confusion: Learning, 32+20=52.]

You turn your eyes to the press of fleeing orcs once more, sparing a fraction of a second to appreciate how they now seem to be fleeing from you specifically, even when that course takes them into the axes and hammers of the dwarves making their slow but unstoppable advance. An instant later, you frown at a pocket of order in the chaos. A large, blubbering orc being dragged away from the corpse of an enormous boar by his... bodyguards? Retinue? Coterie? Compatriots? Whatever social mechanisms drive these creatures, that this orc is important enough to rescue means he is important enough for you to kill.

They barely have time to raise their crude shields before you are upon them, and your sword swings down with enough strength to split one of the orcs from scalp to lower jaw. You shrug off their attempts to strike back as you struggle to free your sword, your rune-toughened skin absorbing what little of their impact gets past the Aethyric Armour, and your shadow lashes out with uncharacteristic grace, one tiny sliver of shadow slipping through orcish skin and ribs to impale his heart, and another putting out both eyes of an orc with a single smooth, darting motion. The survivors push your target away from you and place themselves directly in your path, which only redoubles your determination to strike him down.

But hubris seems determined to make a fool of you, as the orcs show unexpected coordination in forming an impromptu shieldwall, and your sword and shadow alike clatter fruitlessly against the toughened wood. The orcish axes swipe at you as you try to arrest your momentum, and one impacts in what feels like the exact same place as the previous one did, and you both hear and feel the sickening crack of a breaking rib, echoed by a chorus of crunching bones as the Rune of Rancour returns the force of the blow, and then some. For half a heartbeat you feel fear, but then you remember the gift of the Jade College embedded in the bones of your hand. What reason have you to fear Morr? He has already taken what he can from you, and the magics of Ghyran will keep his grasp at bay. A muttered mnemonic, a moment of discomfort as live wood burrows through your body, and once more you feel a sickening crack as your rib rights itself.

Fire crackles against your skin as the Ghyran of the Seed mingles with the Ulgu of your battle magics, and the magic is ignited by Dwarven runecraft before it has a chance to curdle into Dhar. Your shadow writhes in what might be agony and might be excitement, before lashing out and wrapping around the head of an orc, lifting him into the air then smashing him into the ground with crushing force. You take advantage of the gap this leaves in the miniature shieldwall to thrust your greatsword into a second orc's chest, at the precise angle Markus taught you so long ago. The orc burbles as his lung is punctured, then collapses as steel crunches against spine, and you let your unwavering grip on the hilt and the fall of the orc pull your blade free of his body once more. The final orc in your path turns to flee, and you barely bother to strike him down as you urge your shadowsteed to overtake him, and seconds later what you presume to be a Boar Boy Big Boss falls to the ground, trying and failing to scream through a mouthful of dirt as your blade pins him to the ground.

Tendrils of shadow stab downward, but they are arrested by an effort of will. Instead, you dismount and mutter a second mnemonic, and roots burst from your offhand to plunge into the orc's still-writhing body, feeding on his life energies to replenish the magic that healed you.

You try to scan the crowd once more, but the only ones close enough to examine are those too injured to flee at full speed, and the joyous cries of pursuing demigryphs signal that those better suited to a prolonged pursuit have made their way through the narrow valley. So you instead turn to the approaching line of Clan Angrund Longbeards, who stare at you with the stare of a being quite reluctant to admit that there might just be something mannish and young that could meet with their approval. Belegar stands at the center of their ranks, bloodied but unbroken, and gives you a single nod of approval before turning and beginning to bellow orders.

---

If there is any creature more industrious than a dwarf fortifying their position, it is a dwarf fortifying their position when that position is a foothold in a fallen Karak. First the splintered wood from the torn-apart orcish structures is erected into a barricade, and then it is torn down and replaced with stone freshly hewn from the two mountains flanking the East Gate, and that stone is built higher and outwards. Cranes, disassembled, stored, and hauled for months are finally unpacked and reassembled, and cannon and ballista and catapults are hoisted upwards to stand atop the walls, and every so often there is the blast of a cannon or the low twang of ropes unleashing terrible force as some overly curious greenskin is punished for its proximity.

You barely manage to conceal your restlessness as the fortifications grow upwards. The logic isn't unsound, you suppose - if the East Gate cannot be held, all charging into the depths of the Karak will achieve is allowing the final stand of Clan Angrund to finally play out, three thousand years belated. But you can hear crude greenskin horns being blown in the distance as they concentrate their forces, and you've no reason to doubt that below your feet, a more terrible foe has noticed your arrival. Perhaps mannish impetuousness would be better than dwarvish stolidity, or perhaps you're just itching to carry on with the invasion.

As the fortifications rise, Belegar gathers the Council of War to finalize the details of the approach to King's Gate. The gates will be stormed by Clan Angrund, headed by Belegar, and a larger force of Warriors, Slayers and Thunderers will follow them in to push through the hold and identify and fortify chokepoints as Kragg the Grim unseals the armouries and holy places, assuming they have resisted three thousand years of greenskin or skaven burrowing. The Gate itself will be held by the Quarrelers, Rangers, and the Nordlander and Ulrican forces.

As before, dwarven strategy has no natural place for someone with your abilities, so it is up to you to decide what your role will be.

[ ] Storming the Gates with the vanguard.
[ ] Holding the King's Gates with the rearguard.
[ ] Standing in reserve to respond to reinforce wherever needed.
[ ] Going in solo to scout enemy positions.
[ ] Going in solo to cause havoc among whatever enemy is waiting.
[ ] Serving as Kragg the Grim's bodyguard as he unseals the Armoury, the Temple of Grungni, and the Hall of Oaths.
[ ] Joining the demigryph knights as they obliterate any attempt to cut off the attacking force from the East Gate.
[ ] Remaining at the East Gate to help repulse any counterattack.
[ ] Other (write in)


- I'm back. A very long story short: I'm not free of the problems that caused my hiatus, but I have gotten better at fighting them.
- For ease of writing, I've named the Runes of your belt.
- For the scorebook: 1x Orc Shaman, 1x Orc Boar Boy Big Boss.
- Voting will be open for longer than what was usual, which will hopefully give people time to notice this thread lives once more.
- The solo approaches mean you go to the King's Gate several hours in advance of the rest of the force; depending on what happens, it may be possible to join the rest of the force for their attack after (if?) you emerge, but it may not.
