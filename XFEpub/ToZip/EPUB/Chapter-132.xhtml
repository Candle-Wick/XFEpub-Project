With opportunity knocking, you'll not be one to bear responsibility for failing to answer. You dispatch the Undumgi to take the now-abandoned Kvinn-Wyr with orders to take the weapons from the Kvinn-Wyr wall and set up defences against the remaining River and Warpstone Trolls and against the return of the others. You're itching to know where they've gone and why they've suddenly decided that Karag Mhonar was safe to them, but your main priority must be your command, rather than your curiosity. You then dispatch a message along with a third of your rangers towards Karagril with the message you know King Kazador has been waiting impatiently to hear: attack Under-Karagril. You reason that with all of Clan Mors' remaining forces being focused on holding back the Orcs from Karak Drazh, they should easily be able to bottle up the Skaven inside their defensive lines and let them and the greenskins bleed each other as much as they're able. Clan Huzkul will march alongside the Throng of Karak Azul, not least of which because they're one of the few forces capable of matching King Kazador's for sheer enthusiasm, and once more the Border Prince mercenaries will be fighting alongside them for Karagril. You hope it goes as well as it did previously.

You turn your attention to matters closer to hand as you send word for most of the forces currently within the Citadel to prepare to move out. Though they still bear the same Clan names, the forces once of Karak Izor are no less determined to fight to the last for their new home, and their unchanged names are more a reflection of how long it takes for some twenty thousand Dwarves to reach an agreement if they're not forced to hurry. There's some sort of argument among them you're being very careful to stay out of as Princess Edda takes command over the objections of the force's Thane - all Dwarf women are trained for combat, but it's believed they should only take the field under the direst of circumstances. It's a messy debate, but Princess Edda seems to have it well in hand. Clan Angrund needed only the order to start marching, and you doubt they'll ever be a problem - they tend towards the more conservative sorts which often spells trouble for you, but much more than that they're hyper-focused on the reclamation of Eight Peaks, so as long as you continue to deliver results on that front, you could be an Ogre for all they cared. And Braganza's Besiegers are even less trouble, if that's even possible - they're consummate professionals at warfare, and that they specialize in siege warfare means they have incredible patience.

In the center of a huddle of the most skilled and experienced Rangers in the hold, you resummon your MAP of the Under-Caldera and instruct them on their twin tasks: half to cut off all possible avenues of communication to Karag Yar, half to check on the strength of known defences and to ensure that no unknown ones have sprouted since you investigated the area in person. If all goes according to plan, a two-front assault on the Under-Caldera might be your next move, and you're damn sure you don't want to be making it blind, nor with the bulk of Clan Mors forewarned. And with their orders distributed, you double-check the revolvers on your belt and your sword in... wherever it is Branulhune goes when it's dismissed, and move to join the embarking forces. You'll be leading this one in person.

[Assault on the Under-Citadel: Martial, 82+23+5(Strategy: Skaven)+5(Warrior of Fog: Surprise Attack)=115 vs ???.]

Though both Abelhelm and King Belegar tended to lead from the front, you resist the urge to follow their example and instead position yourself as centrally as possible to be the nexus of incoming information and outgoing orders. The unexpected blitz from above takes the few defenders remaining by complete surprise, and their entire line of defence collapses almost at once, and the crossbows of Karak Izor and Braganza's Besiegers ensured that it didn't help reduce casualties. You also know that not all those that escaped the quarrels would be reinforcing the Under-Caldera, because you'd had a word with the We on your way past, and though the concept of warfare was still beyond them, they understood opportunity.

With the battle over almost before it had begun, you move on to consolidation. First, making sure the few injured are cared for, including Princess Edda who has taken a nasty slash across one cheek but barely paused long enough for it to be bandaged. Second, making sure everything is in place to be ready to either move on the Under-Caldera or hunker down to keep what was taken. And third, to check exactly what had been reclaimed. The Under-Citadel was a fringe for Clan Mors, but to the Dwarves it was much more significant. The Hall of Pillared Iron had been sacrificed to gain the allegiance of the We, but much grander prizes awaited - or so it was hoped. With the Skaven having folded so easily and it being some time before you could expect to hear back from scouts or the Karagril front, you check on these personally while your forces root out the few remaining holdouts.

The Arch of Kings was a natural cavern around a swift-flowing underground river, and though the water quality could not be trusted - upstream was the Kvinn-Wyr cisterns, which innumerable River Trolls called home - the cavern remained a sight that brought tears to many a Dwarven eye. It was remade twice by the finest stonemasons of the Dwarven Golden Age, first to accentuate the natural beauty of the cavern and the series of waterfalls that flowed through it, and second to transform the river into a moat for the fortification that was one of the last parts of the Karak to fall. Though the remains of the fallen are long since gone, ancient chiselwork remains on the walls. Here and there the reverent silence was broken by sobs as Clan Angrund discovered the last messages of their distant ancestors.

You move on from that grim sight to what is only known as the First Mine. The Reikspiel name of Karak Eight Peaks focused on the majesty of the mountains, but the Khazalid name of Vala-Azril-Ungol tells another story. 'Queen of the Silver Depths' goes the translation, but the metal 'silver' is Agril. Azril can mean the colour silver, and as Eight Peaks did mine and export a great deal of silver, most human scholars assume that is the origin of the name. But Agril and Azril aren't related in that way; the suffix -ril simply means a beautiful metal, and Azril has a second, older meaning, as Khazalid often gets crowded around metal names. Ag-ril is the aged metal, because its colour brings to mind the hair of a Longbeard. Az-ril is the weapon-metal, known better in these times as Grom-ril, the metal of defiance. According to legend, it was here that the Ancestor-Gods first discovered Gromril; Grimnir cut through the greenskins that once called this mountain home, Grungni hewed the strange new metal from the rock, and Valaya smelted it into the very first Rune. All the mighty acts that saved the Dwarves from extinction and elevated the three of them and their future children into Ancestor-Gods were made possible right here in the winding tunnels carved by the pick of Grungni, and for the past three thousand years it has been overlooked by invaders as just another exhausted mine.

The final significant point is far below, at the bottom of the only set of stairs in the Karak longer than the ones you live atop. It was once known as the Hall of Reckonings, and it was where the archives of all matters of law, administration and trade were kept, as deep once meant safe to the Karaz Ankor. But it too changed meaning and purpose in the Time of Woes. The Cavern of Stars is where the Skaven first invaded the Karak, but the Hall of Reckoning was where the Karak first struck back against the Skaven, as those who had no meaning left in their lives but vengeance tunnelled downwards until they breached the warrens of the unsuspecting Skaven, cutting down a thousand times their number before the panicked Skaven could organize any sort of defence. This place is free of the scratched Skaven runes that fill all other tunnels, and empty shelves surround the massive hole tunnelled into the ground, not a single beam of which has been scavenged. It's almost as if the Skaven still fear the vengeance of the Dwarves. As well they should.

As you make your way back to the bulk of your forces, you understand why King Belegar and the other Dwarves had considered the Citadel for their foothold. Strategically, it was just begging to be cut off and ground down. But the significance of these places is something you're only able to understand after so long spent among them. Where better to fight a glorious last stand than where your Gods walked and your Ancestors fell?

---

You turn your mind back to the matter of war as information flows in. The strike on Under-Karagril was as devastating as you had hoped, and the Skaven bottled into the Karak Drazh Underway remain locked in their constant siege against the greenskins, as good a result as you could have hoped for, and you're surprised to hear that Clan Moulder's holdings weren't quite as looted as you would have expected. Everything that isn't edible has been left where it stood, and though that covers a lot of ground when dealing with Skaven warring with the Black Hunger, some potentially interesting bits and pieces remain. Only with some difficulty do you manage to keep yourself from speculating as to what might have been found and focus on the task at hand.

[Message interception: Intrigue, 69+22+5(Tactics: Skaven)+5(Warrior of Fog: Ambushes)=101 vs ???.]

The Rangers that aren't remaining in place until ordered otherwise report back, and it appears things went as well as you could have hoped. Assuming there's no routes you didn't find while scouting or dug since then, you're reasonably certain word hasn't reached the Clan Mors forces that are presumably still locked in combat with Clan Eshin. That doesn't mean they're not hunkering down of their own initiative, or as best they can with the few forces that remain; according to the Rangers that were scouting instead of intercepting messages, there's at most ten thousand Skaven remaining in the Under-Caldera, and that's if they assume that everywhere they couldn't personally observe is filled wall to wall with Skaven. You doubt there can be more than five. They also report the same thing you noticed in Karag Yar: no slaves. The lowest-ranking member of the local hierarchy they've witnessed is some of the scrawnier Clanrats.

News from Kvinn-Wyr isn't quite what you'd hoped, as it seems some of the River Trolls objected to their new neighbours. The Undumgi report victory despite this, as they had to leave their preferred environment to make their displeasure clear. The Trolls tend to disregard weapons, trusting in their thick skin and regeneration to be proof against them. While that would certainly be true against the crude weapons of the greenskins they'd be used to preying on, the discipline of the Undumgi and the strength of the ancient Dwarven polearms proved superior and only mild casualties are reported. The Bolt Throwers are set up at the avenues leading to the cistern and to the peak, and the Underway to Karag Mhonar has been fortified.

You've enough eyes in enough places to start making some educated guesses about where you don't have eyes. Whatever it was that prevented the Trolls from leaving Kvinn-Wyr is gone, and so are the trolls. The only straightforward conclusion that makes sense is that the Karag Mhonar whatever-it-is is stirring things up in Karag Rhyn and the trolls are settling down in Karag Mhonar, but that doesn't ring true to you; Trolls have two motivating factors, lair and food, and they wouldn't be moving en masse if they were simply spreading out into Karag Mhonar, some would remain behind in their established and now less crowded lairs. So they'd be after food, and they've not been seen in the Under-Citadel, so unless there was some food source in Karag Mhonar that the Rangers missed - and you doubt that - they'd have to have kept going into Karag Rhyn. Which then raises the questions of what happened to the Karag Mhonar mystery?

A problem for later. For now, everything is going just as you hoped it would, and all you have to do is distribute the orders for the next stage of the battle.

Spoiler: Map



This is a map of the underground portions of Karak Eight Peaks. Everything not listed as 'above' is in the 'Under' portion of wherever they are. This is all based on IC information, and is only as reliable as the sources Mathilde has for each piece of the puzzle.







I'll be abandoning the usual voting format for the remainder of this battle. Instead, use [ ] Plan (name) to vote for a specific plan, whether your own or someone else's, or [ ] Poster to vote for the plan put forward by another poster. A plan should say which units are moving where and where to deploy the Rangers, and should also specify whether Mathilde will be personally fighting in a specific location, commanding the fighting in a specific location, or scouting a specific location. A plan can also move siege weapons around, but be aware that they cannot be part of an attack, they can only defend wherever they are. As long as the above is explained in some way or another, any format would be fine.

Rangers can investigate three locations at a time. Scouting can be done alongside an attack to scout, skirmish, and prevent ambushes, or can be done to somewhere not currently being attacked to find out more about what is happening there. For reference, here is a list of places scouting could potentially be useful:

- Karagril-Karak Drazh Underway
- Karag Zilfin
- Under-Karag Zilfin
- Karag Yar
- Under-Karag Yar
- Karag Rhyn
- Under-Karag Rhyn
- Karag Mhonar
- Under-Karag Mhonar
- Kvinn-Wyr
- The Sentinels
- Under-Caldera


- There will be a four hour voting moratorium, and voting will be in plan format.
