    <h2>008.M42 Interlude: Penitent Saviors</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>008.M42 Interlude: Penitent Saviors</b><br/>​</div>Vigilatum was lost, and everyone knew it. Already consumed in traitors turning to the forces of Chaos either out of long-hidden loyalties or desperation when the invasion began, the appearance of further mutant hordes and scattered chaos space marine commanders had worsened matters. Yet while the world had been abandoned to the enemy with the knowledge that further forces had to be drawn back to defend what could be actually defended without certain death, some remained. A doomed rear guard, populated by PDF members who had not reached the transports, abandoned Imperial Guardsmen, and even a small contingent of Sisters of Battle of the Order of Our Martyred Lady. In fact it was the latter that had inspired that desperate lost force of Imperials to not only fight, but survive far beyond even the greatest of tacticians had presumed possible.<br/>
<br/>
Yet their astropathic pleas for aid went regretfully answered, for too many forces were contributed elsewhere. None could spare anything. None could be spared for the sudden arrival of a new fleet of Chaos raiders over Cadia itself with a resounding series of orbital bombardment upon a now exterminated entire regiment of the Death Korps of Krieg before landing further troops had demanded the attention of all. But while despair was high, righteous fury was stronger, and so they continued to fight with the full knowledge that they would simply have to die standing as the rest of their world was twisted further and further into a daemonworld without the intervention of any force that could aid them.<br/>
<br/>
“Quickly, onto the transports!” the space marine boomed, firing over the head of the ducked troopers who fled with deliriously happy tears in their eyes with a full assault cannon into the charging horde of mutants behind them.<br/>
<br/>
A wordless shout was the only warning before a golden-armored marine leapt from an alley of what few crumbling buildings remained in the former edges of the hive, smashing and crushing all of those before it. Thereafter, a banner of flesh that had a hastily scrawled yet ominously glowing sigil of Chaos was sent crashing to the ground as the boom of a sniper rifle sent its bearer to the ground. Before another could take it up, a screaming sister repentia who had set herself aflame charged in, determined to ensure the banners destruction. Though she sustained a dozen mortal wounds, none was able to stop her from reaching the banner and triggering the explosives she’d tied about herself in case the fires were not enough.<br/>
<br/>
“Konan!” the assault-cannon wielding space marine called out, shifting his terminator-armored bulk just slightly so that the dreadnought behind him could step forward.<br/>
<br/>
Crackling with psychic energies, the entombed epistolary raised one machine fist which began to whir wildly before slamming it down to release a repeating shockwave of pure force to wipe out an entire approaching column of troops and the street they came down on. Permacrete was shattered beneath the force, but more important was the warped flesh and bone ripping and breaking from it as well. With another sudden twist of its frame, the assault cannon at its side began to fire as well, shooting deep into the approaching mass.<br/>
<br/>
“Step back, Commander,” crackled the voice of the techmarine who had arrived as well from atop his predator.<br/>
<br/>
The autocannon boomed, its sponson heavy bolters firing in tandem as well, yet for all of the fury of the space marines that had come for the aid of that doomed and lost force, they were being overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
“There are too many, space marine,” the Canoness called out, even as she continued to fire her bolter at every target before her, the rest of her reduced command squad doing the same. “Your actions here were admirable, but we cannot destroy them all.”<br/>
<br/>
“We are not here to save this world, Canoness Alessa,” Aramus responded, shaking his head slightly.<br/>
<br/>
“But-,”<br/>
<br/>
“We came here to rescue you, and deliver you unto a battlefield that will be better served by your presence. Vigilatum was lost. You need not be lost with it.”<br/>
<br/>
“No!” Alessa screamed back, but she did not stop firing. “We have fought too hard, lost too much, to abandon this place!”<br/>
<br/>
“It is already abandoned Canoness!” Thaddeus bellowed as his jump pack carried him over to them. “Recuperate your losses, and come back later perhaps, but staying here and dying serves no purpose!”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=================================​</div> <br/>
In the end of those that had remained behind by will or abandonment, only a fourth were alive to be rescued. They were granted the unique experience of passage within a space marine strike cruiser though certainly they were kept from any and all areas that demanded secrecy. Which in truth resulted in them largely being cramped within a troop deployment bay. The world itself was bombarded heavily as the ship retreated, but there was a certain sullen fury the minds of all who had been so sure they would die there at a later time. And, as they approached Cadia once more, about to plunge through a space theater that had been largely consumed by Chaos, the Canoness could not help but speak up in turn.<br/>
<br/>
“Solar Mariatus fell fully to the Iron Warriors anywhere from a month to five months ago based on these astropath reports,” Thaddeus sighed as he leaned against the tac-table in the center of room. “Without their munitions, the Cadian Gate is that much more vulnerable.”<br/>
<br/>
“There was already a forward base there,” Aramus sighed before slamming an armored fist hard against the table making the holographic images displaying the Cadian System shudder violently. “But now the whole <i>planet</i> can be turned towards their efforts.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Imperium does not have the naval assets to reclaim it at the moment, not while they’re trying to prevent Cadia itself from falling,” spoke the techmarine, Sarrelan if Alessa recalled correctly.<br/>
<br/>
“And Amethal is entirely gone. The Banshee Stone – whatever that is – has broken entirely according to the last reports of the Blood Angels stationed there. A daemon army of varied composition is rampaging its way through realspace and the immaterium towards the surface of Cadia.”<br/>
<br/>
“Damnation!” Aramus growled, slamming his fist against the table again. “Konan,” he pressed the activation rune on the side of the table, “Do we have any more information on the daemonic horde spawned from the Amenthal Warp Tear before it dissipated?”<br/>
<br/>
“None, Commander, though given that the vast majority of them are swarming towards Cadia it is likely that Abbadon and his sorcerer cabals are drawing them there,” boomed the echoing voice of the sole Librarian on the ship from within his dreadnought shell.<br/>
<br/>
“Commander Aramus,” Alessa broke in, the frustration driving her beyond sense for an instant. <br/>
<br/>
The space marines had, of course, been easily aware of her entering the room, the servitor guards outside had not even been ordered to halt her presence if she had arrived. Yet as one all three turned, and faced her with impassive silence.<br/>
<br/>
“Canoness,” Aramus’ voice was neutral.<br/>
<br/>
“What is our destination? Are you delivering us to Cadia to face these daemons, then?”<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Ravens as one slowly shook their heads.<br/>
<br/>
“Cadia’s airspace is too saturated by Chaos vessels, we could not possibly make it to the surface without being destroyed ourselves.”<br/>
<br/>
Her fists tightened at her sides.<br/>
<br/>
“Then we are to simply sit here, in space, just watching as the fight is lost?”<br/>
<br/>
At that, Aramus paused before striding over to loom over her, a sneer on his face.<br/>
<br/>
“Do not insinuate such a dishonorable and cowardly act to a Blood Raven again, Sister, or you shall regret it,” he said with deadly calm before turning and stabbing a finger at the images which still floated about above the table’s projectors. “We are going to Mordrax Prime, one of the vital war material producing worlds left to the Cadian Gate. They are under attack by a <i>massive</i> greenskin force, who intend to claim the Forgeworld for themselves.”<br/>
<br/>
Then he turned back towards her, and lifted a single eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
“You are welcome to assist if you wish, or we can deposit you elsewhere.”<br/>
<br/>
It was not the servants of Chaos that the Canoness desired to burn unto less than cinders, but it was a foe that needed to be fought. Even her hate-soaked mind could perceive this.</div>
