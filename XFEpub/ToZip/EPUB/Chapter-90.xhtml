    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: The Battle of Karag Nar, Part 1</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Take and hold Karag Nar.



The decision is far from difficult. The Citadel is excluded twice over, once by a lack of intelligence and once by it being stuffed to the parapets with greenskins. That leaves either Karag Nar or the Underway, and Karag Nar's relative emptiness makes it an easy pick over the unknowns of the underground. That left only two problems: how the Citadel Orcs will react when Karag Nar comes under attack, and how the forces supposedly under King Belegar's command might react if they clap eyes on the mound of riches you discovered.

It would be nice to believe that everyone would carefully consider the risks of thievery and decide against it, but events have demonstrated to you time and time again that most people are terrible at weighing the odds. Professor de Verezzo and his embezzlement. Count von Stolpe and his tax evasion, the Stirlandian League and theirs. That silly noble during your graduation that volunteered to host your stealth exam even though he had the details of his own financial misdemeanours on the premises. All those Necromancers in Sylvania who thought a fistful of Dhar made them the second coming of Frederick van Hal. And that damned conspiracy that thought they could dangle the Grey Order on their strings with impunity. Everyone has that little voice inside of them that whispers to them that they're special, they can dodge the consequences of their actions. And there's something about the gleam of gold that turns that whisper to a shout.

The problem is not necessarily limited to men, either. Halflings are known for their flexible approach to ownership, and Dwarves tend towards being materialistic - especially the sort who would answer a call to arms based entirely on the promise of payment. Many uncomfortable silences stretch as the commanders admit how few of their men they would trust unconditionally with a mound of riches. Nobody asks you, as your Journeymanlings were too few in number to assault an entire mountain, but in the privacy of your own mind you have to admit that you wouldn't trust either Johann or Maximilian with that level of temptation, and you weren't too sure about Panoramia either.

In the end, it is the Dwarves of Karak Izor that are to be trusted. Their presence here is to recolonize the Hold, not just to retake it, so it is hoped that they'd be less likely to commit a theft in the Karak that is to be their home. It is with great relief that discussion turns to strategy.

The Expedition will be operating under the assumption that the Citadel will know of an attack, and will respond by sallying forth in strength. Some consideration was made to the possibility of not giving any external indication that the Expedition was assaulting Karag Nar, but in the end it was considered too risky. If the force invading Karag Nar found themselves flanked by the Citadel Orcs, disaster would be all but inevitable. So there will be two fronts: the one within Karag Nar, and the one without. And if those defences tipped off the Citadel, so be it.

Under cover of darkness, those siege weapons that hadn't been affixed to the ever-growing fortifications of the East Gate will be moved to bring the direct route between the Citadel and Karag Nar into range. Codrin and his men will defend the siege weapons, Titus and his Halflings will be waiting on the western slope of Karag Nar to add their arrows to the gauntlet, and the Winter Wolves and the Demigryph Knights will be performing the traditional cavalry tasks, except more so because giant wolves and demigryphs make a mockery of cavalry mounted on mere horses. The Ulricans will stand in reserve.

Inside the mountain, Ulthar's Rangers will infiltrate the mountain and pick off as many greenskins as they can before the alarm is raised, at which point they will fall back and the Warriors of Karak Izor will continue the fight. Clan Angrund and Clan Huzkul will stand in reserve.

Best case scenario, the Citadel does not sally and Karag Nar falls as planned, the Longbeards of Karak Izor secure the hoard, and the following night it is transferred to Karag Lhune to be stored within the King's Armoury. Worst case scenario... well, the worst case scenario is always the stuff of nightmares if you have a rich enough imagination. But the worst plausible scenario is that the Expedition is forced into a pitched battle with the Citadel Orcs on the Expedition's terms, which is more than acceptable.

'Karag Nar' translates to Sunrise Mountain, and the assault on it will begin when sunrise does. Surprisingly poetic, but then again, nothing moves a Dwarf to poetry like a chance to kill Grobi and reclaim their ancestral home and wealth.

Esbern and Seija have spent their time with the Demigryph Knights. Fighting on an open plain against small raiding parties of creatures too stupid to learn that they should stop sending small raiding parties into the open plain is a scenario that the Knights have probably spent their entire careers dreaming about, but even in such lopsided encounters attrition takes its toll. And apparently it took it harder on the riders than the steeds, for Esbern and Seija had each been granted the opportunity to try to bond with a demigryph that lost its rider. Normally a nigh impossible task, but with Ghur to tip the scales, both were successful. As you watch them dash about the Eastern Valley on their new kittybird friends, you do your best to combat envy by telling yourself that the logistical capabilities of Shadowsteed outweigh any amount of mauling potential.

[ ] Esbern and Seija will remain with the Demigryph Knights.
[ ] Esbern and Seija will provide magical support to the artillery.
[ ] Esbern and Seija will join the Karak Izor Dwarves for the assault on Karag Nar.

Panoramia has been pottering about spreading the Koo-sha grass she acquired in Barak Varr. Normally the Jade Order would not introduce a foreign plant without long and careful study, but with three thousand years of greenskin occupancy, any change can only be an improvement, and if it does manage to sprout and spread it would provide good fodder for goats or sheep. She's also spent some time in the depths of Karag Lhune, and though she spent a great deal of time complaining that fungi and flora were supposedly as different as plants and animals, she's found a great deal to be interested in in a variety of mushrooms valued by Night Goblins for its ability to absorb ambient magical energies. The Goblins tap into those energies by consuming the mushrooms, which would be the stupidest idea you've ever heard if it weren't for a great deal of other greenskin ideas you've had the misfortune of hearing. Panoramia believes the mushroom might have non-stupid applications, and your curiosity is definitely piqued. Something to follow up after the battle.

Maximilian de Gaynesford has been something of a walking disaster of late, and has had a fairly public falling out with the Karak Izor blacksmiths- though in such a way that everyone else merely rolling their eyes about highly-strung creative types and their making mountains out of molehills. You worry a little more when it's explained to you how to Dwarves, making a mountain out of a molehill implies an even more ridiculous scenario than it does to humans, but everyone who isn't directly involved with the dispute seems to be entertained by it, so it doesn't seem to be endangering Human-Dwarf relations. You ponder Max's previous falling out with Johann, and wonder if this is developing into a pattern.

In any case, the loss of his Dwarvish friends has been balanced out with some new Human ones, and he seems to have somehow befriended Codrin, and has taken to wearing a bow. No arrows, though. He just sort of plucks the string while casting Silver Arrows of Arha. When he saw you watching him practice he claimed it acted as a focus for the spell, but he was stammering far too hard for you to believe him. You try not to judge him too harshly - being a Wizard all too often involves a childhood cut short, and you suppose there's no harm in him reclaiming his.

[ ] Maximilian will provide magical support to the artillery.
[ ] Maximilian will provide magical support to Codrin's archers.

On the other side of the Gold Wizard spectrum is Johann. Johann very much hasn't been making a spectacle of himself. His Trial and Error spell allows him to deliver annoyingly pertinent advice and reminders on literally any subject, no matter how obscure or intricate, and while this was very useful for the artillery crews, it was also extremely aggravating. He's shifted his approach, and now he joins in with whatever task is underway, and the insights plucked from Chamon are now being delivered as a suggestion from a fellow labourer rather than the lofty wisdom of an overseer. It's won him wary friendship from the Dwarves and suspicion from you. Maybe you're being paranoid, but the Grey College teaches that when you find yourself thinking 'maybe I'm being paranoid', you should be more so.

In any case, he hasn't shown worrying interest in Dwarven devices, nor has he disappeared underground to go poking around for the local rats and their technosorcerous toys. That you know of.

[ ] Johann will provide magical support to the artillery.
[ ] Johann will join the Karak Izor Dwarves for the assault on Karag Nar.

On top of worrying about all your little Journeymanlings, you've also got to worry about yourself, and deciding on where you'll be might be the most difficult of all. You're more flexible and more powerful than your charges, but there's only one of you to go around.

[ ] Provide magical support to the artillery.
[ ] Stand and fight with the men guarding the artillery.
[ ] Join the cavalry atop your Shadowsteed.
[ ] Snipe from the outside of Karag Nar with the Halflings.
[ ] Join the Rangers in infiltrating Karag Nar.
[ ] Join the Karak Izor Dwarves in assaulting Karag Nar.
[ ] Other (write in)

If choosing either approach to Karag Nar, select a primary objective for yourself:
-[ ] Neutralize Black Orc priests.
-[ ] Neutralize Black Orc blacksmith.
-[ ] Disrupt greenskin defences.
-[ ] Kill as many greenskins as possible.
-[ ] Secure the Hoard for King Belegar.
-[ ] Other (write in)


- Reminder: the spells each Journeyman knows and what those spells do can be found on the Dramatis Personae threadmark.
- If chosen, Mathilde infiltrating is likely to reach significantly further than Ranger infiltrating, and there's no way to know when the alarm will be raised. She'll react to the situation and pitch in if she spots somewhere it could be useful but the only way to be an integrated part of the assault is to be there when it begins.
- The 'primary objective' subvote was added several hours after the initial post. I'd normally avoid this, but the only alternatives were either deciding what Mathilde would do for the thread, or having the next update be half a paragraph long and having this same subvote then. If you already voted before it was added, please be careful to either edit your primary objective vote into your original vote, or include all your Journeyman votes in your new post.
