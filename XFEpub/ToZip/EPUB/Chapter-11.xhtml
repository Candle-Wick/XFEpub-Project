The Past And Present: Space Marines</b><br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">Apollo Diomedes was a wretched traitor, and he knew it. No one else seemed to have taken the hint however, and so they continued to speak platitudes and greetings to him as he stubbornly piloted the puppet that was his living corpse to the training halls, the chapel, and his meager quarters from day to day. Once, he had possessed some of the largest and best equipped quarters in the Chapter's flagship, but immediately upon Chapter Master Ky...upon Kyr...upon the <i>Traitor's</i> end he had given them up. Even thinking of them burned at his soul and his mind as the shame and despair threatened to overwhelm him once more. It was a battle he fought every waking moment and it was not one that he often won. Quietly, he prayed, to the God Emperor, to the Great Father, to the Unknown Primarch, and he desperately hoped that his past transgressions would not make them turn their gazes away. If they had not already stopped looking upon him the moment he accepted his position in the Honor Guard.<br/>
<br/>
Two centuries. Two entire centuries of lies and false glory underneath the monster that had masqueraded as his friend an as a noble leader. For longer than that had he been a Blood Raven and for longer than that had the Traitor been in command of the Chapter. But it was those two centuries that burned at him most. Entire oceans of poison had been poured into him and he hadn't noticed until it was very nearly too late. If was honest with himself, it <i>had </i>been too late. An endless maelstrom of thoughts assailed him at every moment, a hundred 'what if' scenarios spiraling through his mind. If he had noticed sooner. If he had not lead his brothers into corruption unwittingly as only a staggering amount of ignorance and pride kept him from drowning in it. If, if, if.<br/>
<br/>
He had been so <i>proud</i> when he had fought against Eliphas on Typhon at the beginning of the Third Aurelian Crusade. For there had come the mighty foe of the Chapter that Thule had been unable to defeat. Draped in a twisted deviation of Terminator Armor and covered with the so-called 'blessings' of Chaos and their evil Dark Gods, and he himself with only a standard set of power armor and and more mundane thunder hammer. It was a battle for the songs, for the ages, as tyranids and orks swarmed all around while at the very center of the storm of battle the Blood Ravens clashed against Eliphas and whatever traitor Legion his forces were made from. When he had broken the man who had been defeated once more, he had thought his duty complete.<br/>
<br/>
Oh how wrong the year had proven him. So here he knelt, bowed before the God Emperor and it was here he prayed for absolution.<br/>
<br/>
"Captain Diomedes, I had thought to find you here," came the slightly mechanized voice of his Chapter Master. His <i>new</i> Chapter Master.<br/>
<br/>
"Chapter Master Angelos," he said as respectfully as he possibly could. Which, after centuries of brown nosing to the Traitor, he had become disgustingly good at. In that moment he hated himself more than he ever had before. Yet he remained kneeling and facing the God Emperor. "I am no Captain any longer, neither of the Honor Guard nor of the First Company."<br/>
<br/>
"It seems habits die hard, my apologies."<br/>
<br/>
"I do not blame you, my Lord. I lorded my status over all in my time, I know this. Over <i>you</i> more than once."<br/>
<br/>
He listened and heard the chuckle but resumed praying nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
"I suppose you did. Tell me, Apollo, what do you intend to do, from here on out?" the tone was light, but the question grave. Both of them knew this.<br/>
<br/>
"I...do not know. For too long have I been the lapdog to the Traitor, and I cannot act as I did in the Chapter once more."<br/>
<br/>
"I had not intended to remove you from your position of Honor Guard, you know," Gabriel responded mildly, bionics wheezing as he thumped closer, and then his bulk was suddenly shoulder to shoulder with Apollo's own. "I do not begrudge you for being deceived. We all were, at the start."<br/>
<br/>
"Yet I was one of the last to realize when I should have been among the first," Apollo responded through gritted teeth.<br/>
<br/>
"Should you have been?" came the response, though neither looked towards each other in favor for gazing up at the God Emperor. "By being among his closest it is little surprise he would put extensive effort in concealing his true nature from you. I, by virtue of remaining so distant, realized the issue, but had I been so close to him I might not have."<br/>
<br/>
"It seems that we have both suffered greatly at the hands of those we thought closest to us," Apollo spoke the words even as his mind attempted to drag them back inside of his throat. The calm presence of Gabriel transformed in that instant to a thundercloud of repressed emotion but disappeared soon after.<br/>
<br/>
"You speak of Isador."<br/>
<br/>
"I-,"<br/>
<br/>
"You also speak truth. The wounds caused by those closest to us cut deeper than any xeno blade. But that is the nature of Chaos, and that is why it certainly our greatest foe. But that does not explain what your intentions in the Chapter now are."<br/>
<br/>
Then Gabriel <i>did</i> turn towards him as he stood, providing a hand to Apollo to rise himself.<br/>
<br/>
"You have left your position as Captain of the Honor Guard, and the First Company is non-existent save for those in the Death Watch. What do you wish to do from here Apollo?"<br/>
<br/>
The man who had always known what to do, self assured even before completing the Blood Trials, said nothing. Because he didn't know what to do, and it was as if standing at a cliff he had simply not known was there after more than three hundred and fifty years of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
"I...don't know. How can I repay my debt?"<br/>
<br/>
"Your debt?"<br/>
<br/>
"To the Chapter, to the Imperium, to humanity. For my pride, my ignorance, I served a traitor in an unknowable amount of his designs, how many battles and deployments served Chaos, how many words and meetings with others in the Imperium did the same?" Apollo clenched his fists hard enough to draw blood.<br/>
<br/>
"There are ways, but I do not know what you would choose, Apollo. I would have you remain in the Chapter, and help it grow strong once more, but I cannot fault you for attempting to find absolution. But know this," and a bionic hand clamped onto his shoulder, a hand that should have been filled with blood and bone <i>were it not for his slowness in realizing the truth. </i>Apollo looked up into the slightly taller Gabriel's eyes. "I believe that regarding the redemption that you are so intent on finding...you already found it. When you slew Kyras and carried my own body off of the battlefield."<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel gave him a small smile then, and then the Chapter Master left leaving the former Captain of the Honor Guard behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Apollo remained still for a moment, then turned and knelt once again.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh holy God Emperor, watch over me, and..."<br/>
<br/>
As his prayers continued, his thoughts whirled once more. There were ways, as Gabriel had said. Perhaps the Deathwatch. Perhaps a Penitent Crusade as Aramus was on. But for the first time since the fall of Kyras did he allow himself to wonder just whether or not he <i>needed</i> to do such a thing.​</div></div>
