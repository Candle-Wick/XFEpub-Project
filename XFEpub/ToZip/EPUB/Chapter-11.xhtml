    <h2>The Very Unserious Diary of Abelhelm van Hal</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><b>The Very Unserious Diary of Abelhelm van Hal</b><br/>
Day 1: Dad once said the reward for a job well done is more work. Apparently the reward for rooting out a nest of vampires is being set to root out bloody <i>Sylvania</i>. Did not realize the principle went this far.<br/>
Day 2: Spymaster asked me for money. Fobbed them off on the steward.<br/>
Day 3: Had a talk with chancellor. Incompetent, wet-behind-the-ears kid.<br/>
Day 4: Marshal asked me for money. Fobbed them off on the steward.<br/>
Day 5: Steward asked me for money, reporting that a lot of treasury is missing. Almost fobbed her off on the steward.<br/>
Day 6: Had a talk with marshal. Incompetent 'military history expert', meaning he's read about a hundred battles and fought none.<br/>
Day 7: Attended fancy ball. Managed to not challenge anyone to duel. Chancellor surprisingly helpful.<br/>
Day 8: Greatswords asked me for more money. Fobbed them off on the steward.<br/>
Day 9: Steward and spymaster teamed up to discover someone had stolen not only treasury but also tax ledger, previous spymaster, knowledge of the east wing of castle, nearby bridge, and six miles of road. Troublesome.<br/>
Day 10: Marshal reports 15 000 soldiers stolen, too. Or maybe never existed in the first place and were fraudulently entered on records.<br/>
Day 11: Spymaster reports that marshal used to fraudulently alter records of students. I think I sense a pattern here.<br/>
Day 12: Chancellor reports that the nobles I have politely ignored to date are amenable to making this a mutual long-term arrangement.<br/>
Day 13: Spymaster attacked by gribbly. Collected eight shillings from betting pool.<br/>
Day 14: Got drunk. Hallucinated I was Elector Count. Woke up to find I am apparently still Elector Count.</div>
