    <h2>015.M42 Through 020.M42 Interlude: Of Pleasure And Pain</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>015.M42 Through 020.M42 Interlude: Of Pleasure And Pain</b><br/>​</div>It was, near as anyone could tell, indestructible. Or at the least, it certainly <i>healed</i>. When it had first arrived in the Cadian System, if only briefly, it had torn apart five battleships, a dozen cruisers, and thirty frigates and destroyers with contemptuous ease despite their best efforts. Boarding actions had gone even wore, as by now the gruesome tally of those who had attempted to stop the monstrous thing of warpstuff stood at more than ten entire companies from various space marine Chapters from across the Imperium and over a dozen Imperial Guard regiments. For all anyone knew, there were survivors somewhere on its surface, but that was entirely unknowable at that moment due to the fact that there were literal metric tons of daemons swarming out of weeping sores in its hull structure that were open portals to the immaterium itself.<br/>
<br/>
Kher-Ys was unstoppable.<br/>
<br/>
Where the corrupted and thoroughly tainted craftworld passed, piloted by the deviant and malevolent intelligence which drove it, men and women were driven mad alike. Throughout the anarchy filled Malin's Reach, mothers and fathers were driven to inhuman acts of deviance and cruelty upon their own children, and those children to their parents, simply by the massive vessel passing within above the world. Daemons erupted from the craftworld’s six great portals that had randomly become part of its frame, and all died in an orgy of pleasure, pain, and death. It was here that the first attempt of the Imperium to put a halt to the devastation wrought by Kher-Ys came into being, an entire battle group of devoted space marines and sisters of battle working in tandem to invade its structure, for its warp-powered weaponry and defenses had made conventional void battle untenable.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed after that initial invasion, as more worlds were corrupted, and more men died, until screaming out from within its depths were berthed entire new warbands of chaos space marines who bore mutation and corruption in equal measure alongside similar warbands of screeching daemonettes who still wore the armor of the Sororitas that they had once been. So many places had been lost to Chaos throughout the entire Agripinaa Sector that the exact path of the craftworld was impossible to chart, only that it would appear again and again. At some points, over particularly lost worlds to cults of Chaos that were not of Slaanesh, did it unleash its legions of daemons, marines, and sisters below to either convert or kill. It held no allegiance to Abbadon, evidenced enough by them slaughtering a world lot to Nurgle where the word ‘Typhus’ was wailed to the heavens in despair at the loss of such a champion to the Plague God that bore cultists under the Despoiler’s banner.<br/>
<br/>
But it was the Imperium that bore the brunt of Kher-Ys’ devastating passage.<br/>
<br/>
Isolated battle groups would find themselves swamped by malignant and monstrous things that had once been void stalkers who had grown horrifying ropey flesh that bulged and swelled in random places. What were once the pinnacle of manned eldar vessels had instead become living things, with massive circular maws with spinning saw teeth that bit and tore at the hulls of many a cruiser and lost battleship. Swarms of smaller eclipse and shadow-class cruisers had become as piranhas that tore their way free of Kher-Ys’ body to result in a continual great spillage of physical warp-stuff as the vessel essentially bled to birth them, packs of living daemonships that eagerly ate their way through even the mightiest of Imperial vessels that struggled to make their way to safer ports and greater numbers.<br/>
<br/>
After another year, another attempted invasion was attempted, only for it to go even worse than that which came before. As strike cruisers approached they found themselves set upon what had once been a glimmering series of ships bearing openly desecrated symbols of each of the six major militant orders of the Adeptus Sororitas fell out of the warp with a great and terrible fury. It was, as was proudly proclaimed from sacred communication channels meant only for the holiest of hymns to be sung across the darkness of space, a fleet which was led by the infamous Miriael Sabathiel, Warlord of Slaanesh. To the consternation of the space marines, fifteen companies all from various assorted Chapters, did they find themselves boarded in a great flow of daemons and corrupted sisters of battle. Teamed from one end by such a massive fleet of once-Imperial vessels, and with the steadily approaching and hungry Kher-Ys on the other, once more was one of the greatest single concentrations of Imperial might brought low. Hundreds of marines were dragged away, deep into Kher-Ys’ depths where they were brought to the dark ruler of the living mass of daemonflesh and warped wraithbone, upon a throne made of the flesh of not just the Seer Council of Kher-Ys but their entire families as well.<br/>
<br/>
It whispered by sources unknown that when Captain Michael of the Death Eagles’ 3<span style="vertical-align:super">rd​</span> Company was dragged forth before that twisted thing which had once been but a mere Keeper of Secrets, once been but a mere Avatar of Khaine, his soul was brought into Slaanesh’s embrace the moment he met its blazing gaze of black and pink fire. It is said, somehow, the nightmares finding their ways into the minds of many an astropath across the galaxy, that as the once stalwart space marine slumped forth, a mad grin literally splitting open his face from ear to ear as the warp overtook him, that a voice cried out in horror and shame and grief from the very foot of the throne. A body, melded with the living but mindless flesh of the Seer Council and their mothers, fathers, their siblings, and children, yet possessed its mind. The girl who had allowed the Greater Daemon known only as Heartslayer into her world cried out, and yet she could not, would not die, for her ‘patron’ would not let her.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, around the edges of all sectors affected by the Black Crusade of Abbadon, did Kher-Ys and the Sisters of Sabathiel appear again and again. To the enemies of Slaanesh, which encompassed all who forswore the Prince of Excess in favor for anything else at all, they were pure death. To those that worshipped the correct God, they were saviors and demagogues, their ranks swelling again and again. For the Sisters of Battle, the sight of the one sole member of their kind who had ever willingly turned to Slaanesh, or so they told themselves, was too much. Thousands launched themselves at her fleet, to slay her, for she could surely not be turned back to the Emperor’s Light after so long willingly drenched in heresy and Chaos. Thousands of them died, and yet thousands more found her words, her touch, her very presence enough to erode their minds, bodies, and souls.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever dark pact that was struck between Heartslayer, Master of Kher-Ys, and Miriael Sabathiel, it is not known. What is known is that the craftworld and its attendant entities was soon enough joined by her fleet, their combined forces transforming them in one massive instant into the largest active Slaaneshi warband in the entire galaxy outside of the Eye of Terror and the warp. They held under them untold numbers of eager daemons, the possessed fleet of Kher-Ys, hundreds of chaos space marines, tens of thousands of mutants and cultists, as well as the unknown numbers of sisters of battle that Miriael had brought under her sway. They shattered the White Consuls, leaving but one Company of an ten to flee back into the protective arms of their brothers as they nursed their wounds. Three companies of the Iron Snakes were destroyed or dragged away to suffer the tortures of Slaanesh as they fought to ensure that a great number of refugees could flee from their lost world in the Scarus Sector. The battle of Praxis Prime was a terrible defeat for the Angels of Vigilance and the Order Of The Furious Chalice, who lost four companies and the full one thousand sisters of battle of the Order Minoris who had attempted to save the planet. Those shattered remnants of the Emperor’s Children who had fallen into madness and utter anarchy after the Battle of the Bloody Hill throughout the Black Crusade found their way, through warp and transport and other means, into the welcoming arms of their brethren.<br/>
<br/>
For all of this, Abbadon hated them. They openly denied his authority, attacked his followers, denied his true deserved mastery over all who swore themselves to the Dark Gods, and yet he could not challenge them. His forces were busied, engaged, and while more often than not the Despoiler was skilled enough a tactician to take advantage of the great chunks ripped from the Imperium’s hide by the twinned servants of Slaanesh, he hated them all the same. Truly after all that they had done to scorch the very souls of the Imperial forces aflame, their greatest insult was yet to come.<br/>
<br/>
Eschara, the homeworld of one of the Despoiler’s most consistent foes, the Astartes Praeses Chapter known as the Excoriators, had been in the middle of being burnt to the ground. For they had faced ships which tore their orbital defenses to pieces that then withdrew in accordance to the wishes of the one they had delivered to the surface, Khârn the Betrayer and his Butcherhorde. Yet even as the massive Butcherhorde, the single greatest swelling of World Eaters unified since the last time the Lord of the Red Sands had graced the materium with his presence, swelled with further chaos space marines, of cultists, of mutants, of daemon engines, and even daemon princes, did Kher-Ys and Sabathiel appear above the just barely deployed Butcherhorde.<br/>
<br/>
Blood enough was surely spilled, then, to please Khorne greatly even though much of it was that of his own followers. The Blood God cares not, this is known, from whence the blood flows and only that it does. For those followers of Slaanesh, on the other hand, it was the chance to show that true perfection in battle was far superior to the maddened swings and animalistic bloodshed favored by the followers upon He Who Sits Upon The Skull Throne. In this, they denied the followers of Khorne out of capricious and malicious spite, joyously bombarding them with chemical weaponry and orbital fire to vaporize their frames before they could even have the chance to cross their elegant and sensuous blades. Tens of thousands of bloodletters and daemonettes clashed upon a training field crossed by thousands of loyal Excoriators while elsewhere the melding between Avatar and Keeper known as Heartslayer personally took to the field. In one hand it bore a corrupted Wailing Doom, in the other a bladed whip with shards of the very crystallized concept of pain given physical form studded throughout which easily tore through ranks and ranks of the eldest of World Eaters left in the galaxy such that their souls were greedily drunk by Slaanesh rather than their own God.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout it all, the stubborn sons of Dorn remained, battling from their slowly crumbling Fortress-Monastery holding the banner of the Excoriators high.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it was the forever birthing womb of Kher-Ys which tipped the tide. For while many a daemon of Khorne was summoned to such mighty displays of bloodshed and favor of Khorne being given by so many skulls taken, the six great portals in the hide of Kher-Ys which blazed not just with the light of the warp but with the maddening visions into the deeper realms of Slaanesh itself releasing a flood of daemoneettes, of fiends, of chariots and hounds, of things for which there were no name but were unmistakably bearers of Slaanesh’s symbols and favor. It is even said that the Masque might have manifested to dance to death a screaming Daemon Prince of Khorne, though none can say for sure due to the sheer mass of warp-flesh which swarmed over the planet. All of this, of course, provided by prey for the one known as The Betrayer by so many, yet it was his Butcherhorde that paid the price. The souls of the World Eaters were happily devoured, even as the screaming berserkers slaughtered ten times their number until their axes choked with the daemon offal and died to a hundred singing and glittering blades.<br/>
<br/>
As for Khârn himself, he found himself atop a mound of a thousand daemonette corpses, matching blow for blow Heartslayer itself, the combined powers of an Avatar of Khaine and Greater Daemon of Slaanesh matched by sheer bloodlust of one of Khorne’s greatest champions. Yet the Perfect Prince’s followers knew the prize that they held before them, and so more and more began to pile atop him even as he fought, only making the corpse mountain higher and higher as Heartslayer’s more malleable body shaped itself to keep battling equally. Amidst the carnage, the last of the Butcherhorde, one of the greatest of masses that served Khorne with success and blood, was brought down by corrupted space marine and sisters of battle alike who giggled and screamed as they too were killed in turn.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the Excoriators died. Sabathiel brought the eldest and most powerful of her transformed former sisters, and shattered their Fortress-Monastery with an army in twisted mockery of that which the Ecclesiarchy’s militant arm itself bore. Pleasure Engines, pumping all a manner of chemical cocktails into their occupants rather than pain and endless hypnotherapy, tore at the walls with the strength of dreadnoughts and glee of excited small children. Immolators that spewed warpfire rather than the cleansing promethium of their purer cousins burnt down their banners and melted through their gates and defenses.<br/>
<br/>
All the while, Sabathiel herself strode atop a series of daemon possessed exorcist artillery engines, turned instead into an armored division known only as the Sounders of Slaanesh, bearing a massive <i>thing</i> which might have resembled a stringed instrument of ancient terra, were it not made from the combined flesh of a slain inquisitor, six daemonettes, and strung with the hair of her very own corrupted sisters. From atop the Sounders did she play a song of horror and madness, and did a vast and incredible blast of noise, from a hundred daemon-tuned sonic cannons, was the Fortress-Monastery of the Excoriators completely torn open for tens of thousands of her followers to dive in and slay the remaining defiant companies.<br/>
<br/>
Those that followed her most slavishly with yet minds of their own, swore that they saw Sabathiel visibly swell with power as her armor and weaponry glowed with the light of the warp in that instant as the last of the Excoriators died. But soon enough, did the victorious champion turn to the last battle occurring on the planet left, as the rest of the denizens of the world were given over to the twisted desires of those that had conquered it. For a mountain of corpses that grew endlessly for all the daemons that charged up it to attack the apex, from where a joyously defiant Khârn still stood, battling a wearying Heartslayer, did Sabathiel arrive. For those who follow the Skull Throne’s wishes, it would be easy to simply deny that one of their mightiest champions could be defeated. Yet the defeat of Angron upon Armageddon proved it false. For too long, had those of Slaanesh been denied their own strength, and their failures within the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade only impressed this point further upon the minds of all.<br/>
<br/>
No longer.<br/>
<br/>
From behind, was The Betrayer pierced by the daemonblade of Sabathiel, from the bottom up and out through his throat. Yet even with such a wound, did Khârn twist, his own body shattering her blade and nearly slaying the warlord of Slaanesh then and there. The daemon within the blade was consumed by the very essence of The Betrayer, and extinguished in that instant. Heartslayer moved forward to take advantage, only to find a great gouge torn in its chest by Gorechild, an impossibly still alive Khornate battling not just the champions and shards of Slaanesh but furiously beating back death itself on sheer hatred and desire for blood.<br/>
<br/>
Until, it was, that Sabathiel rose back up, twisting her skull about so that it was once more properly aligned, and summoned forth yet more weaponry. Attacked, now, by the same endless swarm of Slaaneshi daemons, noise marines, Heartslayer, and Warlord of Sin herself, did even the incredible bloodlust of Khârn fail to win out. For sure, it could have, it must be known, but it could not force his body to defeat the precise and perfectly placed strikes of his foes, their speed winning out over his strength a dozen times a minute. For each daemon that he struck, each skull claimed, each foe slain, all to please Khorne, he bled that much more himself from yet another series of wounds. So cloying was the stench and power of Slaanesh over that world which was already twisting into a daemon world, that Khorne could not rescue his champion, though whether or not he attempted to do so or merely accepted that a truly worthy skull would once join his throne is for those who would lose their minds contemplating such things.<br/>
<br/>
But death did not come, to perhaps the astonishment of some.<br/>
<br/>
The events of that day are known to any and all who will listen to the boastful servants of the Prince of Excess. For was Gorechild torn from The Betrayer’s grip, as well as his arms, while the still living, breathing, biting champion of Khorne was dragged away from Eschara as it slowly continued its transformation into a daemon world. Into the depths of Kher-Ys was Khârn dragged, his legs eaten by the stomachless Heartslayer. One of his arms was devoured, the ceramite covering it, the flesh within, and the bone at the center, by Sabathiel while the other was kept as her personal trophy. Around her neck even now dangles the teeth of Khârn, melding artfully with her armor-flesh. Gorechild, claimed as a trophy by the dancing Masque before it disappeared into the warp once more. Only then, as Eschara completed its transformation into a daemon world, great citadels of flesh and bone and steel rising all whilst bearing the sigils of Slaanesh and blooming with daemons, did Kher-Ys and its incredible prize flicker and disappear into the depths of the warp once more, into the deepest portions of Slaanesh’s realm, where it is said that The Betrayer was delivered to the foot of the Prince of Pleasures itself, deep within its palace.<br/>
<br/>
What happened next, is not known.<br/>
<br/>
What is known, however, is that the daemons of Khorne batter at the borders of Slaanesh’s realm daily, in vaster numbers ever known than before. Or at least, that is what is said, by those who claim to be able to be capable of witnessing such events without being struck down for peering so deeply into the affairs of the Dark Gods. What is known, is that Sabathiel’s warband only grew further from that point on, as it attacked the forces of Abbaddon who did not serve her God and those of the Corpse-Emperor alike. That the Violators, so inspired by her victories, did rise up and join her. That even some Emperor’s Children Warbands began to trail alongside her as her flagship, the Desolator-class battleship <i>Sinbringer</i> forged forth into the greater galaxy to bring Slaanesh’s touch to the worlds beyond the Astronomicon’s light, to perform the most profane of activities upon those who had not even the slightest chance of the Imperium’s protection.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, more ships poured forth from the Eye of Terror to join Abbadon bearing the stamp of the Iron Warriors, of daemon-forged constructs made by Warsmiths fell in line. Dozens of previously independent warbands of Khorne, of Nurgle, of Tzeentch who had shied away from the <i>Sinbringer</i> and Kher-Ys alike found their temporary protection under Abbadon as unto shackles, his forces newly swollen and strengthened by those who knew they would be struck down by Sabathiel’s forces for the temerity to deny the Prince of Chaos’s rightful dominion over them – or so those that served Slaanesh would say. Those that were not still under Abbadon’s yoke, at least. The Butcherhorde had fallen, its leader taken, and yet many more servants of the Blood God yet seethed with the urge to spill blood, many appearing from across the galaxy, dissatisfied with the failures of others or not wishing to join the Red Corsairs under Huron Blackheart.<br/>
<br/>
The Imperium had suffered, as Abbadon had, but none knew whether more damage had been dealt to one…or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout it all, 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade ground on.</div>
