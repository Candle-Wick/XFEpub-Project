The meeting was to take place elsewhere from Aerus. The Mechanicus did not relish any Inquisitorial presence near their worlds. Especially for one that openly possessed the taint of Chaos upon it despite its cleansing. In either case, you were more than capable of doing so, taking the <i>Litany of fury</i> back to Subsector Aurelia so that a ship bedecked in but black and silver with the sigils of the Inquisition burnt into its frame to come smoothly into one of the loading bays. It was, in fact, a thunderhawk which had exited from the nearby cruiser which by its profile was anything but a mundane example of such things. Then the thunderhawk stepped down, and you allowed both Justinius and Hannibal to step forward as its two inhabitants exited.<br/>
<br/>
“Halt!” Hannibal boomed, his crozius crackling, as the two space marines did just that, their stances defensive in their own right.<br/>
<br/>
You had to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
You had to be.<br/>
<br/>
Both had been in service while Kyras was Chapter Master. You had to be sure. Both understood, thankfully enough, especially Uther, but Hamul was more reluctant. Only the sight of his former Captain calmed him enough, the obviously aggressive assault marine being left only somewhat tempered by his experiences. As it was, the whole of your Librarius turned out, all of them present, to scan them down to the deepest bedrock of their souls, bodies, and minds. Any lingering taint, loyalty to Kyras, and you would have them killed. It was the only way to be sure when it came to things like heresy.<br/>
<br/>
And yet they passed, and knelt before you.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master Angelos,” they said in unison.<br/>
<br/>
“Welcome home, brothers. Such as it is,” you reply, bidding them rise.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” Hamul speaks up suddenly, even as Uther similarly appeared ready to speak. “I…wish to apologize for my tardiness. I could not yet return to the Chapter before now, and for that I am filled only with shame. Not when the Blood Ravens needed all of its brothers it could possess,” he bows deeply before you.<br/>
<br/>
“He speaks truly,” Uther rumbles, shifting his stance slightly to lean on his crozius. “Both of our Watch Fortresses had committed Kill Teams against the necron of Pacificus.”<br/>
<br/>
“We…,” Hamul’s fists clench at his sides, “Struggled, to put down enough of their Lords for them to retreat.”<br/>
<br/>
“And yet,” you murmur, once more bidding the surprisingly emotional veteran to lift his head, “You succeeded. The necron are a truly terrible foe, and that you have returned successful is more than enough. Now come,” you gesture towards the innards of the battle barge, “There is much you should know of what has become of the Chapter in your absence.<br/>
