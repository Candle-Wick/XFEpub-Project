<div style="text-align: center"><b>Blood and Steel<br/>
+006.M42+<br/>
+<i>Honor The Emperor</i>+</b>​</div> <br/>
“Strike with all of your fury, Captain,” you intone gravely, nodding only once in Captain Marcus’ direction before he departs with the rest of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company.<br/>
<br/>
“And you as well, Chapter Master,” he calls back behind him as he clambers atop the <i>Litany of Purgation</i> that has apparently during his own fighting become almost a personal mount.<br/>
<br/>
The scars the heavily tested and ancient vehicle bears are almost as grievous as what Marcus himself has suffered, yet just as the Captain itself it stoically continues on after being declared capable by the techmarines and techpriests. Indeed, that alone is one of the most valuable parts of fighting alongside the servants of the Omnissiah, their ability and resources at repairing vehicles, armor, and weapons outstripping all other servants of the Imperium. It is well that they have not given you up for the miasma of suspicion that Kyras has left behind him after his destruction. In fact, as you march towards your own troops, you get a look of exactly what you have been striving for – a mighty and honorable force of pure and zealous space marines charging off into battle.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” Tarkus greets as you take your own position, next to the mighty terminator-clad bulk of one of your few remaining Captains. “Are we to move out?”<br/>
<br/>
“Indeed, Tarkus,” you nod, hands grasping tightly around the haft of <i>Godsplitter</i> as your bionics hiss and wheeze so quietly that only you can hear them. “Blood Ravens!” you call, raising the hammer high and garnering the attention of your troops. “Today, we have joined our brothers in the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company in battle, and we grant them the honor of leading the charge! Today, we go to strike out against the mad daemon-machines that have infested this place since the Horus Heresy! Today, we shall unleash our fury! Today…,”<br/>
<br/>
The call is then taken up by all of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company, terminatos and dreadnoughts bellowing in tandem.<br/>
<br/>
“NONE SHALL FIND US WANTING!”<br/>
<br/>
And then the Chapter, as best unified as it can be under its knife-edge circumstances, moves forward into the undulating metal wilderness of Aerus, the ragged cheers of Imperial Guardsmen following you as they notice you leaving.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">======================================<br/>​</div>Only an hour in, and you find yourself silently acknowledging the truth of Cyrus’ words that this was no world to test the scouts and neophytes of the Blood Ravens upon. Upon leaving the watchful targeting sensors of the tremendously heavy defenses of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the somewhat bleary and bloodshot eyes of the Imperial Guard scouts, you were set upon immediately. The size of the convoy or column matters not to the maddened denizens of this world, and you personally observed as bolters boomed and chainswords snarled their way through hundreds of strange multi-pedal creatures ranging anywhere from grossly misshapen things that might once have been human corpses to an insect-like monstrosity made up of largely hands and teeth which was almost half a mile long that thrashed with unnatural and potentially unholy strength enough to knock a dreadnought through a wall.<br/>
<br/>
The shadows hide only more foes, there is no way around or simple point to flank. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Captain informs you of this based off of his own experiences as a series of twisted metal machines that were once likely meant to be civilian transports that carelessly spouted burning promethium from various points on their metal bodies is blown apart by his heavier weaponry. The landscape itself will literally rise up and swallow any force that would attempt to do so unless possessing the greatest of numbers – and so Marcus and now you will leave such things for the Mechanicus to throw it’s skitarii legions into. Indeed, more of the cybernetic monstrosities burst out of the thousands of years of crashed and layered levels of rust and broken machinery in a stream almost akin to puss, yet they crumple and ‘die’ just the same when you slam your hammer into them.<br/>
<br/>
It is when you hear a roar that shakes the earth for miles around that you see sight of your foe. Time dragged on for hours as the Blood Ravens relentlessly battled their way through the hostile landscape, having long left the lines between skitarii and the rest of the world behind, but your foe is not one that is easily hidden. And surely, if the Mechanicus here now, they would froth at the sight of such a piece of mechanical debasement and heresy that shambles forward on its cobbled together forelimbs. A head that is almost ursine in shape unhinges a jaw of blackened and endlessly bubbling steel to reveal a soul throttling and unholy light within its gullet, clearly giving credence to its taint by Chaos. If that wasn’t enough, a series of rivets have been placed into the things forehead in the shape of the eight pointed star, which even now blazes with Chaotic light.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if it were standing upright on two legs it might be the same as a Imperator titan in sheer height at the least, but thankfully that is not the case. That is all that there is to be thankful about, as erupting from its scrap metal flesh are hundreds of turrets and guns, from what might even have been something once of tarantula turret design and other weapons as small as simple laspistols. Already Marcus is ordering various weapons to begin firing upon it, as he and other troops prepare for what is apparently the method they have determined to slay the beasts.<br/>
<br/>
To approach close, carrying bombs and melta weapons, all the while your Chief Librarian battles the empyreal elements of the creature to slow it. And yet it is a fight that you relish, to battle once more amongst the ranks of your brothers in numbers such that the shameful truth of how depleted the Chapter truly is fades away for just the moment as you instead focus yourself wholly upon the battle. As dreadnoughts advance, in such numbers as to crush many, many times their own number with heavy bolters blazing, you find yourself observing as Marcus screams his orders that are followed to the letter, his helmet scarred over the left lens only marking him our further. The training you have done with Apollo shows itself in further dividends, the otherwise bulky armor of a terminator shifting with your movements with an ease that you had not felt in far too long. It has returned to you, your old speed and skill, the augments that replaced your life working with you easily and well. An idle thought, processed and filed away before your heart can even finish a single beat, is that perhaps this is what many Iron Hands possess. The strength, at the least, is welcome for you.<br/>
<br/>
Marcus distinguished himself further, leaping atop the head of the false titan and engaging its own disgustingly similar defenses to a being of flesh than of metal, shapes rising up and lashing out at him. In time, however, the sheer damage the creature began to sustain, it’s haphazard void shielding falling as its ramshackle generators are hacked at, shot at, blown apart, or simply melted under the steely gaze of Justinius. Apollo soon leapt forward with a great number of melta and krak explosives that a lesser marine would have struggled to even lift, and threw them unerringly into its throat that had been carved open by the scapel of lascannons and heavy bolters.<br/>
<br/>
Its explosion as titanic, yet its death swift. Truly, you were in fact surprised at how quickly the great machine fell apart. A true titan would never have fallen so easily, but even then a fair number of your marines in the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company find themselves injured enough to force the Chapter to retreat back to ally-held territory. Apparently without the warp connecting to it, the machine fell apart and revealed just how near ork-like it’s design was. Its components literally began to melt off of each other once the true power holding it together – Chaos – was banished by the grim efforts of your Chief Librarian.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, by the ways he bled from the eyes, nose, and ears, you know that it was not nearly the easiest of psychic demonstrations that he has ever partaken in.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=============================================<br/>​</div>“Your aid was most welcome today, Chapter Master,” Marcus greets you from where he sits unarmored on a medicae bed for Constantius to examine him. “Those things change in shape and armament every time.”<br/>
<br/>
“And yet you faced at least four before we did arrive,” you reply, unarmored yourself as you watch his wounds be checked over. “That alone does you credit.”<br/>
<br/>
“Credit enough that I lost fifteen marines,” is the bitter young marine’s reply, the singular mass of scar tissue that is his head turning away from you to face the wall where presumably his gaze turns as well. “This is a truly deadly battlefield – the foes are in the land, beneath it, and numberless. It is almost as if we fight mechanical tyranids.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now there is a thought that brings me pause,” Tarkus says from behind you, pushing forward into the medicae bay to reach out and exchange a comradely shaken hand with his fellow brother-captain. “But you should banish such doubts, brother. You have done well indeed.”<br/>
<br/>
Marcus shrugs, though he does turn his head back in the direction of Tarkus.<br/>
<br/>
“I cannot shake that feeling, that I should have done better somehow…but at the least I know that I shall in the future. As for what we spoke of earlier, I am sure that even my brothers will be cowed by the training you have in store.”<br/>
<br/>
“We shall see, Marcus, we shall see.”<br/>
<br/>
It is a welcome sight, to see Blood Ravens meeting in bonds of true brotherhood and friendship untainted by suspicion and paranoia. Enough that you leave them to their own negotiations about the training of their respective companies and turn towards the thunderhawk which will return you up to the ships which remain above, so that you can attend to your own training. Speed and dexterity have returned to your limbs, but to stop at something satisfactory is foolish. It is improving that you now shall focus yourself upon, to lie idle is to invite heresy into your heart and mind.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">[Training With Apollo – Agility From 5 to 6: 369+50= 419/600]<br/>
[Chapter Training – Toughness From 5 to 6: 320+100+Tarkus(25)=445/600]<br/>
<br/>
============================================<br/>​</div>The crack of the sniper rifle echoed briefly through the jungle, as all the orks of the Boss Stabguts’ Boyz, as the name of the local group was known, ceased in all activities. Boss Stabguts grunted, and slowly lifted a hand to prod at his skull and at the hole that was suddenly there. It was, all things told, a big one, and certainly not one that he remembered having. The bleeding it was doing was also a bit annoying. The hulking ork turned about, his squinted eyes glaring at all of the confused and shocked orks as he scanned for the dumb git which had done that to him.<br/>
<br/>
“All roight you gits. Which wanna you-,” was as far as he got before the second round blew the rest of the top of his head off.<br/>
<br/>
A mile and a half away, Cyrus grunted and loomed over the scout who had made the shots in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
“That was…disappointing, initiate. One shot, one kill. I told you to fire into his eye socket. Are you so inept that you <i>can’t</i> using the finest weapons in the galaxy?”<br/>
<br/>
“Captain Cyrus-,”<br/>
<br/>
“No excuses. Pack up, and let’s move on. They heard and are aware of the direction of the second shot, and they’ll be coming.”<br/>
<br/>
True to his word, the orks began to swarm the position soon after, though by then the rest of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company had left the entire area behind.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================<br/>
[Junius Negotiations: 87/100]<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">The message this time is not sent by astropath, if not in its entirety. Instead, they merely communicate that the rest of the negotiations are going to be continued in person. Soon enough, a small flotilla of the Imperial Navy appears above Junius where you had just arrived aboard the <i>Omnis Arcanum. </i>Communications are soon established and you are granted the odious pleasure of hosting one of the 'esteemed' members of the Administratum who have so far been the main reason it seems that your Blood Ravens have been refused again and again from establishing yourselves at least some small presence on Junius. For the first moment after they step off from their own transport, you are struck by the idea that they dared to send a mere servitor to you, such is the weight of papers and useless-seeming trinkets layered about their person. Until they speak at least.<br/>
<br/>
"Chapter Master Angelos," its vocoder scratches out in a reedy voice, "I am Prefect Vareto. We shall speak of the planet Junius and it's changing of records."<br/>
<br/>
"In what way, Prefect," you speak as you glance at its guards, as well as the dozen or so servo skulls that come floating out bearing quills already twitching on parchment.<br/>
<br/>
"Of the reassignment of the planet Junius from," and then a stream of incomprehensible gibberish erupts though some of the consonants sound familiar, "To that of Astartes Recruiting World Secundus Priority-7."<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, Prefect?" your heart wells with appreciation for this, though some part of you cannot help but be naturally curious. "I thought that there was more resistance to this at the hands of the Guard and Navy from elsewhere in the Sector."<br/>
<br/>
"This is true," Vareto acknowledges with a shuddering motion that might have been a nod if it weren't obscured by several pounds of scrolls and dataslates hung all about its frame. "They desired to claim the world as their own for recruitment, and until recent events occurred it was unknown if the Blood Ravens should instead possess a world if they were soon to go extinct."<br/>
<br/>
How dare - ! No. However much crushing strength is now suddenly applied in the clenching of your fists at the very thought of them assuming such, you let none of it show on your face. An act somewhat aided in that half of it is metallic and unmoving.<br/>
<br/>
"What...changed then, Prefect," you grind out.<br/>
<br/>
"New orders requiring massive levels of recruitment from worlds already accessed," the Prefect answers almost immediately, "There is less time required on average for a space marine recruiting world to be assessed as such and less required in infrastructure build up compared to Imperial Guard recruitment efforts."<br/>
<br/>
You grunt as a magnificent gilded vellum scroll is delivered to you, written in the blood of the 'Kings of Junius' to signify their swearing allegiance to the 'Emissaries of the King of Stars'. Holding it, you cannot help but feel the smallest bit of relief. You have lost Cyrene and Typhon, with the planet Aurelia lost for all recruitment-related efforts long ago. But now you have Junius, and from all reports they are a brave and unyielding people who are similar in culture to that of Trontiux III, though where on one world there are Kings the other has Barons. It does not matter. You should send Cyrus to the planet immediately to test their measure and begin at least preliminary investigations into Blood Trials on that world. Orks on one world are orks on yet another, are they not?<br/>
<br/>
"The Blood Ravens are honored to be granted this opportunity, Prefect Vareto, but I find myself desirous to know of just what had caused the Guard and Navy to pull back from such affairs."<br/>
<br/>
Vareto shrugs, or at least some of the scrolls about his shoulders shift as some servo skulls appear and begin scrawling upon them.<br/>
<br/>
"System Caeserion's Hrud Infestation is growing worse, and as such Segmentum Command has ordered a massive redeployment of all forces available within the sector and elsewhere."<br/>
<br/>
Interesting. And a potential issue as well, you know. Subsector Aralakh shares three systems, and Brutalia is near enough to Caeserion that if the Hrud truly do form one of their terrible Migrations then all you have worked for here - both for Aerus and Junius - could be lost in the longer term. It is just as well that the Navy and Guard have focused themselves upon a true foe rather than attempting to interfere with the efforts of your Chapter.<br/>

[] Break Mad Machine Mass, a grouping of insane tanks and armored carriers whose Machine Spirits have gone mad and are traveling as one mass and attacking everyone and everything they can, heading straight for the Skitarii Lines.

With your own vehicles, and heavy weaponry, this could be made possible. The further the line stretches and expands, the better it will be for all. And at the least, you would not be sending astartes into enemy territory and instead they would be fighting alongside allies. (Write-In Forces)<br/>

<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of Recruits</u><br/>
- The only thing that can truly help the 10th Company is time, dedicated time, to train your initiates, neophytes, and scouts.<br/>
- The time is almost up for our current group of neophytes to be unable to advance further ever again if they are not assigned gene-seed from our limited stores. If we do not elect to push the current 1st stage neophytes onto the 2nd stage, their bodies will have matured too much for further implantation to be possible - meaning a tremendous potential loss in space marines that will instead be relegated to serf status. In total, we have 45 neophytes that if they are not advanced by the end of this year, they will have aged too greatly. We have enough gene-seed to implant all of them, and it is not likely that all 45 will survive regardless meaning that the gene-seed will be recovered. The decision is yours, Chapter Master, especially now that we have another world to recruit from.</div>
