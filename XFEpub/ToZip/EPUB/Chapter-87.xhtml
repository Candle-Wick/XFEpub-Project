    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: The Battle of Karag Lhune, Part 3</h2>


Spoiler



[*] Remain here and help Ulthar make sense of the reports flowing in.



You came close to leaving, but as you looked over Ulthar's shoulder, a memory from a few years ago stirred - the Siege of Castle Drakenhof, when Halflings first discovered the caves underground and the Dwarf Rangers and Miners scouted them out, mapping an intricate tangle of tunnels and caverns and shafts, culminating in the destruction of a column of skeletal foes that were so thoroughly ambushed you never bothered to discover if they were Wights or lesser terrors. Memories of that campaign were still raw for you, but that part of command had been exhilarating - being the nexus of information for an entire army of eyes and ears and minds, taking the information from a hundred scouts and a thousand sentries and weaving them into something near enough to the truth to be weaponizable.

You pull up a boulder and join Ulthar at his table, piecing together sketched maps and listening to his descriptions as a mental map starts to form. From time to time a runner comes from the fronts, and upon seeing you they switch from Khazalid to Reikspiel. Rangers tend to be bilingual, if only to be able to properly threaten trespassing manling prospectors, and for the Rangers of Karak Hirn, that meant Reikspiel. Soon you know enough to know what you don't know, and you start sending orders back with the runners and deeper within the tunnels, Rangers begin to push back the borders of what is known.

[Ulthar's leadership: Martial, 74+20=94.]
[Mathilde's cave-mapping: Martial, 100+19=119.]

"You can never have perfect clarity," Ulthar is saying, waving a hand at the four sketches that all claim to be of the same tunnel junction, but all disagree on the number of branches. "Work around it. When we're hauling out the corpses, then we can figure that mess out."

"Durek says-"

"Even if he's right, it'd be a hell of a risky gambit when we can just wear that redoubt down. They don't even have bows there."

"Okay, granted. But look at the other end of the spectrum - if Rekthor's report is right, then the entire Squig-purging front is exposed, that enormous pocket that's bottled up in the assembly hall-"

Ulthar stares at the map, then shakes his head vigorously, sending his beard waving. "It can't possibly connect up there. Look, you're sharp for a manling, but you just don't have the Dukkul, the tunnel senses for this sort of thing."

"Look, it's- oh, by the-" You scrabble as the stub of pencil rolls across the slab of stone, then swear as it drops off the far edge. Overwhelmed with frustration, you reach out, grab a handful of Ulgu, and slap it into the air. "This is the pocket, right? We've barricaded it in here, here and here." Grey smoke thickens, then flows obligingly down invisible channels. You can see it so clearly in your mind and projecting it into the air in front of you seems a thousand times easier than explaining again to the obstinate Dwarf how a bunch of Rangers hacking away at half-grown Squigs could be about to get about three hundred fleeing Goblins to the rear. "Here's what we thought was the dead end coming off it, here's that weird interwoven bit, here's the edge of the Squig caves, and if Rekthor's report is right, here is where that junction branches off towards the hall."

The expression on Ulthar's face is alarmed as he leans away from the unexpected display of manling wizardry, but then he frowns in thought and leans in close. "Oh, krut," he breathes, then leaps to his feet, shouting a stream of Khazalid at a runner nearby as he grabs his axe from the table. He pauses just for a moment to tell you to take over here as he sprints off on the heels of the alarmed runner.

As the footsteps recede into the distance, you consider the hanging model of the tunnels, reshaping it with a few stray thoughts. In maps, Dwarves favour blue for friendlies just as the Empire did, but for fairly obvious reasons they use green for foes instead of red. You compromise, marking the known pockets and redoubts of greenskin farmers in green, and the spider-infested parts of the map in red. You refresh your memory with the accumulated sketches and scraps as you fill in the rest of the tunnels, and once it's gotten back to the room you're in, you smile to yourself as you mark your position with a nice rune of Ulgu.

Then you come to a halt, and stare at the faintly glowing construct taking up half the room.

---

It's an oft-told joke that looking like you know what you're doing is taught at the Colleges. In the case of the Grey College, it's no joke at all. By the time the next runner comes in, there's nothing to suggest that this was anything less than planned, and his look of alarm, then recognition, then wary curiosity is one you grow very familiar with over the next hour. The reports coming in clarify the few remaining hazy parts and allow you to clearly delineate the edges of spider territory, and the runners go back with orders that allow you to rapidly reduce the remaining patches of green, as Rangers emerge from unexpected angles behind the makeshift defences that the greenskins have established.

Ulthar returns covered in sweat and blood, with his quiver empty. He edges cautiously along the edge of your Ulgu construct and resumes his seat with a huff. "Met them just as they were running down the tunnel," he says. "Damn near clogged it with their bodies before they broke. We harried them all the way back to the hall, where they met the lads that had been bottling them in." You gesture, and that last bit of green vanishes. Ulthar traces it back and forth with his eyes. "That's not a dead end, it joins up over there," he says, and with a thought you correct it. He scans it for further errors, then grunts. "Handy," he finally admits. "So we're done here?"

"No concentrations left," you say. "There'll be stragglers here and there, though."

"Always takes a week or so to fully winkle the last of the bastards out. Only major problem is the spiders, then."

The two of you work together, and by giving up a few tunnels and rooms you reduce the cordon to three chokepoints, each with a clear field of fire for the defenders. Once the rest of the Karag is taken care of, then attention can be turned to the spiders - or they could just be starved out, you suppose. Either way, half the Chiselwards have been secured, and most of the dwarves here have been freed up. As they take the opportunity to eat, drink, and catch their breath, news starts to filter in from the other levels.

[Hangars: 22+15=37 vs 73+10=83. Sending reinforcements.]
[Hangars: 97+15=112 vs 55+10=65.]

The Hangars, far from being the wide open caverns that the Thunderers that went there had expected, turned out to have been transformed into an enormous greenskin metropolis, and handguns that could take a Goblin off his feet at a hundred paces were little help when the Goblin is leaping at you as you go around a corner or duck through a door. It had turned into a bloodbath by the time reinforcements arrived, and it remained one afterwards, albeit one that no longer favoured the greenskins. The Knights of the Winter Wolves seemed to terrify the greenskins, no doubt used to wolves that were both significantly smaller and being ridden by Goblins. The Ulricans and Nordlanders that fought alongside them had no compunctions about fighting fair, and Ulric may demand bravery but he doesn't demand stupidity. They quickly took to simply knocking over every ramshackle building they saw and stabbing anything that tried to emerge from the wreckage.

[Kragg at the Hall of Oaths: 95]
[Kragg at the Temple of Grungni: 9.]
[Kragg vs the Temple of Grungni: 60+20=80 vs 27+10=37.]
[Kragg at the King's Armoury: 60.]
[Contents: wealth: 89.]
[Contents: weapons: 45. Two sets, rolling...]
[Contents: siege weapon: 27. One, rolling...]

Kragg had unsealed the Hall of Oaths without trouble and left the stoneworkers there to begin the ongoing task of continuing the list of the fallen from where it had been interrupted three thousand years prior. You can only imagine his reaction when he reached his next destination, the Temple of Grungni, and found that its doors had been breached and the insides had been transformed into a shrine to greenskin gods. You don't have to imagine his reaction shortly after, as everyone is telling of how he walked through the spell the resident Goblin Mage-Priest had tried to defend itself with and then hit it so hard that it left a crater.

His final destination, the King's Armoury, was a topic of some concern for you. Belegar had made a fair few promises on behalf of the legendary riches of Karak Eight Peaks, but the main treasure vaults of the Karak were almost exactly opposite the Expedition, under Karag Zilfin, and the lesser ones were within Kvinn-Wyr and beneath the Citadel. As it turns out, your concerns were misplaced. The Karak did not fall all at once, and the silver mines of Karagril remained working long after the treasure vaults had been sealed. Much of that wealth had been lost to the invaders or spirited away to other Karaks, but the majority had piled up in the closest thing the Dwarves had to a treasury in what remained to them: the King's Armoury.

(You're briefly distracted by contemplating long-dead Dwarves obstinately mining and refining and smelting silver even as the hold is lost to invaders, but manage to shake yourself free to hear the rest of the contents.)

You're told of row after row of beautiful polearms, a thousand each of a dozen different designs, each made of a silver-iron alloy made of the two ores native to the Karak, still as sharp as the day they were forged and with wooden hafts that have aged to be even stronger under Dwarven runes of preservation. You've never heard of a Dwarf wielding a polearm, but apparently in ages long past it was quite common, before the onslaught of Skaven and Night Goblins necessitated new tactics. You wonder if they'll start once more.

The other discovery was of gromril hammers, once belonging to the bodyguard of the Kings of Karak Eight Peaks and bearing powerful and ancient runes, many of which were thought forgotten. Perhaps that went some way to mollifying Kragg's rage.

The final discovery of note is a bolt thrower of some sort, but the Dwarves seem fairly tight-lipped about it.

[Highways: 79+15=94 vs 71+10=81. Fierce fighting. Reinforcements already sent to Hangars. Belegar heading down.]
[Highways: 75+20=95 vs 75+10=85. Fighting continues to be fierce. Chiselwards Rangers joining the fight.]
[Highways 84+25=109 vs 14+10=24. Enemy finally breaks.]

Finally, the fighting below all else turned out to be the fiercest of all, and calls for assistance ended up pulling in Belegar and Clan Angrund, and the Rangers you freed up from the Chiselwards. The Goblins fought bitterly for every step down the great, half-collapsed stairway that wound around a great empty shaft that once carried cargo from the Grand Avenue below to the Hangars above, and a single missed step was all it took for anyone, Goblin or Dwarf, to plunge the length of the shaft into the Grand Abyss below. A final vast chamber was the last pocket of resistance, its existence not even guessed at and apparently dug out sometime after the Karak had fallen, and there the fighting finally ended and the Crooked Moon Tribe broke completely, fleeing downwards and into the darkness of the Grand Avenue. Belegar called back those that went to pursue, and as they barricaded the entryway between the Avenue and Karag Lhune, the fleeing greenskins cried out in terror one by one before being silenced by whatever new foes lurked out there.

The War for Karak Eight Peaks has barely started, but the Battle of Karag Lhune is won.

---

The extermination of a Night Goblin tribe was exhausting. Cleaning up after said extermination, you can only imagine. But those Dwarves that didn't directly contribute to the Battle of Karag Lhune leap at the opportunity to be a part of history, many of whom joined the expedition as wanderers, vagabonds and outcasts. The work is fuelled by innumerable casks of ale freshly arrived from Barak Var, and a joke goes around that completely evades what little grasp of Khazalid you have, but seems to trigger much chortling and slapping of knees among the Dwarves. Then it goes around again with more thoughtful pauses around it, and as the sun begins to dip in the sky, King Belegar gives his first edict and Clan Huzkul is born. Any Clanless that spilled blood or hauled corpses is welcomed into it and made a citizen of Karak Eight Peaks.

The atmosphere is not exactly jubilant, since everyone is either exhausted from the day's fighting or hard at work, but the ale flows freely and uncharacteristic optimism shines on the face of every Dwarf, and the Ulricans and the Nordlanders are getting along quite well with their new comrades-in-arms. A train of wagons goes back and forth between the East Gates and Karag Lhune, mostly hauling ale; every now and then Orcs from the Citadel find themselves no longer able to resist temptation, and the vast flight of stairs have become a very tall set of stadium seats to cheer on their inevitable doom, either from artillery fire from the East Gates or from a punitive sally from Demigryph Knights.

There's still work to be done before the Expedition can be considered a success, as the sight below you attests. For the Karak to consider its position even slightly secure, the final leg of the tenuous link between it and Barak Varr cannot be over such exposed territory. But that's a problem for tomorrow. For now, all you need do is accept the odd tankard of ale from a Dwarf brave enough to approach the manling Zhufokrul, and decide how you'll spend this subdued but well-earned quasi-celebration.

You seem to have invented a spell. What will you call it?

- Congratulations on your second ever natural 100.
- There may be long-term benefits to getting close to people, but there won't be any direct consequences for this decision. Consider this a short break from the fighting.
- Minimap Spell: Acquired. It allows you to project, edit and colour a fairly low-resolution 3D visualization. It is Relatively Simple and seems to be similar to Marsh Lights; it could be considered an illusion but its eerie glowiness makes it poorly suited for deceit.
