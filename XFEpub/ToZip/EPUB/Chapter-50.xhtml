    <h2>010.M42 Interlude: From War To War</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>010.M42 Interlude: From War To War<br/>
</b>​</div>By the very nature of the galaxy, travel in any direction at any time was never fully certain in its success. Time and space were fanciful trappings that did not necessarily involve themselves when it came to the most common form of transport that many of the races of the galaxy possessed. In certain times, and perhaps some of the most horrifying of occasions, those who entered through the warp were not granted leave by its masters. At other times, sometimes as a capricious joke and at other times as simple undirected whims of fate, to travel was to invite arrival before or after one departed. A century after a departure could easily be the result of a simple leap from a star system to its neighbor. Generations lived and died before relief fleets came, the war over long before. Other times ships would arrive from nowhere expecting a fight only to learn that they had come before the threat would even begin to grow.<br/>
<br/>
And yet.<br/>
<br/>
By sheer, bullheaded strength, could such things be put aside. Distance and time ground beneath brutal and unyielding will that demanded and could force such things. By cabals of those who were ‘gifted’ with the touch of energies beyond the understanding of any but their own kind and barely known by those who were, by the refinement of machinery in the madness and inspired intelligence of minds beset by insanity and genius in unbalanced measure. It was by these things that the warp could be traversed and for all the endless tides of daemons and unaligned creatures that fell upon what could not be denied as a feast with fangs to defend itself with it could not be stopped. Stymied, perhaps, but never stopped, not by such things as that.<br/>
<br/>
Octarius. Charadon. The shattered remains of Alsanta left behind from Farsight’s fury. Empires brought to heel, survivors rallied and sent in different directions.<br/>
<br/>
The whole of the WAAAAAGHH!!!! Gorbad. Of an Urgok who was broken upon Ryza whose survivors fled for greener territories to rally. Entire WAAAAGH!!s upon which massive hands had wrapped around throats and bound into servitude with slaughter and noise and pain. It did not matter their goals, their targets, their wishes or whims. All were sublimated beneath might that could not be challenged by even the greatest amongst them. To ask if there was a goal in mind was to gain a cracked skull or even death in return by cuffs that were absentmindedly powerful enough to do so.<br/>
<br/>
And yet.<br/>
<br/>
It was simply impossible for such a mass of life to go ignored. Not when it passed and burned and pillaged its way to the west, driven by visions in the minds of a leader for whom actual madness was still a debatable companion of the mind. Life, glowing with light in many cases, acting as beacons of that tremendous sheer bulk of souls and flesh that happily bounded forth again and again beneath that which led them with bellow and example. For those of humanity, it was something to be feared and then fled from when their meager defenses failed. For those of the eldar, it was a sheer weight that they could not lift for all of their spent strength and was something to be simply avoided while other plots came into being and were enacted. For a dozen and more empires and republics and individual civilizations who had just begun to peek into the bloodied stars, they were death.<br/>
<br/>
In turn, death itself lifted eyes long turned cold. Eyes of crystalline circuitry, veins that steadily pumped with lightning, and dulled hearts consumed by a steady and unrelenting hatred of all things living began to rise from many a dead world. How could death not arise, when iron-shod boots in their billions and billions stomped upon that had once been cities turned tombs in the depths below? Ships which drifted in the black felt energies thrum from reactors and engines left to be cold before the next harvest was to take place, only for hyper-advanced machinery to examine and collate data on a fleet of hulks of utterly reprehensibly chaotic and haphazard design that passed as if like a great river before them.<br/>
<br/>
Such a mass inevitably stretched out, for all that the Arch-Overfiend, the Great Prophet, the Overlord, and whatever other sundry titles its lickspittles offered up, forced them. They were not of all one mind, merely of one general will. Throughout a Segmentum that had been blessed to be free – comparatively at least – of the taint of the darker things of the universe and instead was plagued by renegades and xenos in equal measure, there stretched an ocean of green flesh and muscle. Throughout a Segmentum through which death had stretched its merciless metal fingers, did an ocean divided and spread out so fully find itself abruptly attacked from within and without by what was already dead.<br/>
<br/>
For the Maynarkh Dynasty, most brutal of all the Silent King’s former servants, it was but an extension of their one true purpose: the genocide and systematic extermination of all life. The Imperium had been a good start. But these orks in their trespass would face the full and utter might of all who served Xun'bakyr, until they were less than ash.<br/>
<br/>
So declared the Mother of Oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===============================<br/>​</div>There was a flash of green light and the resounding sonic boom of displaced air which sent all of the cyborks present flying in all directions. To be sure, they certainly yelled and screamed, but none of them could actually be heard over the resounding beating heart of not only the machinery all around them but by one single voice which had screamed endlessly for years.<br/>
<br/>
“RAAAAAAAAGGGHHAAAAAAAAAGGGHGHG!!”<br/>
<br/>
Ghazghkull cracked his neck from side to side, and absorbed the resulting hundreds of rounds fired at him from all directions as the defenders and defenses all around him began to fire. For a moment, he opened his great maw to speak, only to blink in surprise to hear that he couldn’t hear his own voice. With great stomps did he stride forward, then, rending apart some most advanced cyborks he had ever seen apart with his power klaw in one hand and the firepower of his own guns. Before him, of respectable size, stood the frame of the maddened one he had come to find. Dozens of wires and cables were stuck not only into the skull but the whole of the body and the spine, and from a throat replaced with machinery after he flesh had been shredded raw by constant screams, did he glare down at the mad master of the hordes he had just tellyported past.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“……,”</b></span> Ghazghkull bellowed out, at a volume enough to shake the ground all around him, and yet to his bemusement it went unheard.<br/>
<br/>
So he lifted up his power klaw, and cut the Arch-Maniac of Calverna apart to the shock of all those who had managed to stand up after his initial bulling through them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Huh. Well, dat was somefing,”</b> </span>he grunted before shifting his bulk around to glare down at them all. <b>“<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000">Now den, dat git might have been smart and shiny, but ‘e clearly let dis place make ‘im go crazy. You gits, you like to foight?”</span><br/>
</b><br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Uh, yeah,”</b></span> one of the larger cybork nobs responded, voice unsteady as they looked at the largest ork they’d ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Yeah? But ‘ee,”</b></span> Ghazghkull gestured over his shoulder at the chunks of meat that some tubes and cables still connected to, <span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Done made ya foight <i>dumb</i>, no direction to ya!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
Then he chuckled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“You’ze gonna foight <i>gud</i> now.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">====================================<br/>​</div><span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“GARAGHAK YOU DUMB GIT!”</b></span> he bellowed at the bottom of the Ravenspire, or to be more precisely at the dead ork warlord at his feet. <b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000">“How could you up and die to some zoggin’ little- gragh!</span>”</b> Ghazghkull stumbled as he felt the telltale sensation of a massive shoota doing its shooting at him.<br/>
<br/>
Armor pitted and scarred found itself finally failing as the concentrated bolter fire of over a hundred revealed ambushing heavy bolter-wielding Raven Guard fired upon him and the rest of the teeming orkish mass which had made land on Deliverance. With a grunt, and a minimal acknowledgement of his injuries, the Great Prophet slapped at his side, and in a greenish flash found himself back on his space hulk. Growling, he turned, and glared at the two Meks who were arguing over the tellyporta pad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Garaghak done got himself krumped by dem Raven Guard boyz,”</b> he grunted,<b> “Yer boss just done got himself dead, Buzzgob. Dey got dat dumb git to ram dat battlefortress o’ his into der bombs, so yer precious ‘ultimate ride’ done got krumped too.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
With that, he turned his attention towards the second Mek.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Orkimedes, you gotz any news for me?”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
The master of tellyportas and other such things sucked deeply on his fungus-cigar before tapping some ash onto the ground and grinding it out with his boot.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, boss. I gotz some bad news. We’z getting chewed up in th’ back of the WAAAGH!! by some dead-boyz. A lot of ‘em.”<br/>
<br/>
Ghazghkull blinked at the news before grinning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Which wun of dere klans is it, den? I’ze know it can’t be dat ‘Stormboss’ ov deres, we’ze not close enough to ‘em.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
In response, Orkimedes pulled out a large hunk of metal, the orange-glow of the sigil burned into it lighting up the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Dey’z got a boss what calls herself ‘Da Movver of Oblivion’, and she’s shredding our boyz, boss.”<br/>
<br/>
Ghazghkull was silent, to the surprise of both meks, before he slowly grinned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“We’ze got dis Deliverance place done surrounded, and we’ze got plenty of boys to krump it…’cept now we’ze got buggys comin’ through on one side, more Imperial boyz on the other, and <i>behind</i>…dead boyz. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!”</b></span> his laughter shook not just the tellyporta room but in fact the whole area for a truly terrifying distance within the innards of his space hulk.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“WHAT A GOOD FOIGHT WE’ZE GOT GOIN’ ‘ERE!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
The Great WAAAAGH!!! bled from a thousand wounds, and laughed the whole while as it was brought to its knees while swinging in all directions.</div>
