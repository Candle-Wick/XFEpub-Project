    <h2>Waaagh Birdmuncha, Part 4</h2>
While the view from the towers atop Karag Nar is as spectacular as ever, as a vantage point for the coming Waaagh they're rather lacking, even with  the air in front of you filled with various summoned lenses to try to get a closer look. One of those lens arrays is focused on a large slate that has been set up on the eastern side of the Citadel for them to pass on any information too complex for the flag signals, but it remains infuriatingly blank. The only indications that this is far from an ordinary day in the newly reborn Karak are the empty fields below and a constant flow of gyrocopters in and out of Karag Lhune. Apart from watching the aerial ballet, you've nothing to keep yourself occupied except your nerves and rubbing Wolf's belly.

Finally, the first piece of information goes onto the board: WAAAGH AT WESTERN GATE. You fidget with the lenses to try to adjust your view of said gates, which remains unchanged. WARBOSS GIVING SPEECH TO WESTERN GATE. You snort. Reasonable assumption, you suppose, that the Western Gate would be manned and defended. You reach out with Ulgu to brush against the enchantments that make up the Eye of Gazul, reassuring yourself that they haven't disappeared in the last few minutes. Then, at long last, movement is visible at the Western Gates, as a handful of Orcs strain to push the massive wooden gate open, and then Waaagh Birdmuncha begins to flow into the Karak in earnest, a tide of Orcs charging around and occasionally being flattened by the Pump Wagons their Big Bosses lounge on and shout orders from. The Wagons are bigger than you imagined, and more solid, the smallest of them being large enough for three Orcs. The largest you can see could hold a dozen, were it not holding the Warboss and a motley collection of weaponry. And there's also the Snotlings, who are far too small to keep pace with the Waaagh themselves. Every Wagon is swarming with them, which you expected, but every Orc also has at least one of the tiny greenskins clinging to them, the luckier ones sticking heads out of pouches and backpacks, the unluckier ones clinging to clothing or limbs and trying desperately not to be jostled free.

You turn your eye to the largest of the Wagons, and your immediate impression is that Warboss Birdmuncha the Really Zoggin' Big matches his name twice over. Despite sitting down he still towers over the Orcs running alongside his Wagon, and attached to leather straps running along his chest, back and arms is the plumage of what must have been an enormous bird, adding more bulk to his already enormous frame. His face is covered by a blank metal mask, and he glowers through the eyeholes at the horde running alongside his Wagon, occasionally gesturing and presumably shouting commands. Weapon racks stand to either side of the stone throne standing atop the Wagon, and in front of him is a Bolt Thrower of Dwarven make, albeit heavily defaced with Orcish glyphs and with the original bowstring replaced with a much thicker and cruder one.

Karag Lhune disgorges the remainder of the Eight Peaks Aircorps at once, a dozen gyrocopters emerging like angry hornets and then disappearing out of sight to fly along Death Pass, to strike the Waaagh's stragglers and give them the false impression that the Caldera represents safety, and you force yourself to untense. Your part in this battle is still some time off, as it will take at least an hour, and likely closer to two, until the entirety of the Waaagh has squeezed through the West Gate. An uncomfortable thought when thousands are pushing through it every minute.

---

The Orcs quickly discovered that the Citadel was occupied as the first Orcs to get within range were utterly peppered with arrows and bolts. Overkill, and definitely a missed opportunity compared to holding fire until more had entered range, but the lesson to be hammered home here is that the eastern portion of the Caldera means death, to encourage them to stick to the western portion, where they are vulnerable to the Eye of Gazul. A few hundred Orc archers try their luck and are quickly scythed down, and an armoured Pump Wagon trying to cautiously approach the Citadel is obliterated by three simultaneous cannonballs. The Waaagh mills about uncertainly, faced with no fight worth fighting and no clear avenues to proceed upon, and all eyes turn to the Warboss, including yours. This is the moment upon which fate turns. If the Warboss decides to try to penetrate one of the undefended Karags, you'll have to fire the Eye early, with at least three quarters of the Waaagh still out of sight.

The Wagons circle around Birdmuncha's and the Warboss confers with the Big Bosses and Shamans that they contain. Every so often you glance over at Karag Lhune, where gyrocopters returning to reload pass on the latest estimates of how many Orcs remain in the Western Approach. As the debate amongst the greenskins is temporarily shelved for Birdmuncha to wrestle an underling into obedience, the 2 and 5 flags are taken down and replaced with 3 and 0. Not even a third. You cross your fingers and mutter a prayer to Ranald. Finally, an accord is reached, and the Bosses begin shouting orders in every direction. The Wagons disgorge Snotlings by the hundreds and each Orc evicts their hitchhikers, and tens of thousands of tiny hands set to work digging through the soil of the Caldera. Surely they don't think they could get through the stone and into the Under-Caldera? But with one eye on the Citadel for any order from King Belegar to fire early, you watch them as tunnels begin to take form and worm their haphazard way towards the Citadel, marked by frequently resurfacing Snotlings trying to regain their bearings. Sappers, then.

You look sideways to Karag Lhune. 4 and 0. The majority of the Orcs still remain outside the Caldera. You build a MAP of the Caldera and mark everywhere you see the Snotlings coming up for air and orders to keep yourself occupied, and are surprised at the speed with which the tiny greenskins are digging, but just at unsurprised at the inadvertent zig-zagging that seems to be going on. Only the Snotlings are digging, which fits what you know of greenskins - no sense for Orcs to do the work when there's someone smaller they can make do it instead, after all. A new addition to the slate - PLAN UNCHANGED. You send up a blue Marsh Light in acknowledgement and do your best to relax.

4 and 5. A Big Boss clambers down from his Wagon to try to split up a Snotling brawl from two tunnels colliding.

5 and 0. The tunnels cross the first of a series of very small ditches. This one marks the maximum effective range of the siege weapons. Having range markers on the battlefield would normally be invaluable, but that only works if the enemy is above ground.

5 and 6? They must only have one flag for 5.

6 and 0. The ditch that marks  the furthest volley fire range for the Fieldwardens and Quarrelers.

6 and 5. Some of the Orcs are disappearing into the tunnels now. Are they Overseers? Are they just bored? Or are they beginning to mass for an attack when the saps break the surface? You look to the slate once more. A runner is talking to the Dwarf in charge of it, and that Dwarf scratches his beard, looking at the message still on there. He writes STILL, and draws an arrow to indicate its place between PLAN and UNCHANGED.

7 and 0. You'd have expected the flow of Orcs to slow as the last stragglers filtered in, but if anything they seem to be coming faster, and you can see fights breaking out and Orcs trampling each other underfoot as they try to squeeze through the bottleneck of the Gates.

7 and 5. A gyrocopter lands by the Citadel, its rotors not even powering down as the pilot clambers out, screams his message at a runner, and then climbs back aboard and flies back to the battle. Your eyes become fixed to the slate. WOLF GOBLINS MAULING WAAAGH. STRAGGLERS PANICKING.

8 and 0. Another gyrocopter touches down at the Citadel. A runner disappears into the Citadel. A minute later, another emerges, and speaks to the Dwarf on slate duty.

FIRE AT WILL.

Well, then.

You take a deep breath, and the merest thought from you causes the tower to react, and Ulgu begins to seep into the room from the Room of Dawn and Dusk below. The console remains untouched as you reach out with your magic to interface with the various enchantments that have been woven into this tower, and they in turn reach out to you. You feel an entirely new sense blossom, and can feel the sun directly above you, and a thought from you has the Tower poised to change that immutable fact, or at least trick this general area into thinking you have. An itch at the back of your head indicates the Blue Tower and the Red Tower prepared to come to life, but you dismiss them and they return to their slumber. And just on the edge of your perception, you can feel a minute sliver of the attention of an immovable object turn to you. For a moment you have the sense of a sliver of light at the bottom of unfathomable darkness, and then it passes.

Burning Shadows is not a difficult spell by any means, and it has something of a reputation in the Grey College for those who learn it becoming very excited at the possibilities before they start to grasp its limitations. It is not especially damaging, especially compared to what the more rambunctious Winds can achieve, and where most spells require a competent Wizard or a sturdy shield to be defended against, Burning Shadows can be foiled by a sunny day or a well-lit room. But none of that matters. At this time and in this place, it is a delivery mechanism, and with the work of the greatest minds of the Grey College and the greatest Runelord of the Karaz Ankor gone into it, it can deliver in any cardinal direction and what it delivers is devastating.

You center yourself. You exhale.

All noise vanishes. The sun jerks in the sky. The Caldera is plunged into shadow. And for a single exhilarating, terrifying moment, you feel power you can't begin to comprehend flow through you.

[Eye of Gazul: Learning, 31+27=58.]
[??? vs ???: 23 vs 20]

Burning Shadows is selective in what it burns, and the criteria used can be incredibly vague or incredibly specific. The dominant theory is that the spell draws information from the caster's mind to differentiate targets from non-targets. Either something else is going on here or there's a significant flaw in that theory. Because for an instant that stretches into what feels like hours, you glimpse one greenskin after another for a fraction of a second each and mentally confirm that, yes, it is an enemy of the Dawi. Apart from some being Orcs and some Snotlings, the only variation is the scarce handful of vultures mixed among them, following hopefully in the Waaagh's wake and likely destined to be very disappointed. And throughout the entire process you can feel the energy of the Waaagh like an unpleasant vibration in your teeth.

In the instant before a half a million deaths, the Karak suddenly seems very, very small, and you can feel the attention of immense powers upon it. One is as familiar to you as your own soul, and you can feel His amusement and anticipation. Another has just thrummed through your soul, and His attention is already moving on. A third eyes the Karak dubiously, and nudges His brother to go deal with it, who nudges back, no, you go deal with it, and the two fall to bickering.

(one, encompassed within a single body but no less powerful for it, moves through halls of stone long remembered, a pat on a shoulder here, a gruff word of encouragement there)
(one, brooding and angry and indecisive, has a fraction of His attention here, but in the same way that a fraction of your attention might linger on the throb of an old scar)

But despite all that attention, the only one acting is you. So you act. The world goes dark. The membrane between what you consider reality and the realm of souls and gods ripples as five hundred thousand links between the two are severed at once.

And then you are only Mathilde again, and wince as the room takes on the feel of being slightly too sharp and bright, all the Ulgu that filled it drained away in an instant.

The Caldera below you is still. All that was green is now black.

You want very much to crawl into bed, hug Wolf to you and refuse to come out for at least a day or two. But you have a duty. Three blue Marsh Lights rise into the air, and Karag Lhune disgorges a gyrocarriage. You give Wolf a pat, inform him that he's now in command, and climb down the stairs to meet your transport on the balcony.
