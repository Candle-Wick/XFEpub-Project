    <h2>Introduction and Chapter Missions</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center">It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.<br/>
<br/>
Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.<br/>
<br/>
To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.<br/>

==================================<br/>

+Knowledge Is Power, Guard It Well+<br/>
<br/>
You. Are. A. Blood Raven.<br/>
<br/>
Adeptus Astartes.<br/>
<br/>
Angels of Death.<br/>
<br/>
Scions of the Unknown Primarch.<br/>
<br/>
And your Chapter is dead.<br/>
<br/>
Or at least nearly so. Were the Blood Ravens to be represented as a single space marine, it would be one who would more likely than not be incapable of living even if placed within a holy dreadnought. Now you sit in the latter third of the 41st Millennium atop a pile of ashes and bones.<br/>
<br/>
The Third Aurelian Crusade is done. Three Crusades, all within Subsector Aurelia and home of the majority of your recruiting worlds over the course of twelve years. Before that came the Kaurava Campaign, before that the Dark Crusade, before that...Tartarus. In such a short period of time has your Chapter been battered again and again, before finally...it broke.<br/>
<br/>
Not to the predations of Xenos, but by the machinations of Heretics. Your own Chapter Master, Azariah Kyras, a servant of Chaos for over a century, had done more to destroy the Blood Ravens than the efforts of the thrice damned Eliphas the Inheritor, the enormous Splinter Fleet which came to consume all, the Eldar who planned to burn the entire Subsector to stop said Splinter Fleet, and the orks being <i>orks</i> combined! Through his efforts and corrupting presence, he engineered a devastating Civil War and attracted the attention of the Inquisition, as well as the devastating Exterminatus.<br/>
<br/>
Brother turned against brother, and Chaos erupted across your entire Chapter. To be sure, through faith and determination victory was achieved, and an uneasy peace finally reigns after twelve years...but at what cost?<br/>
<br/>
Force Commander Aramus, suspect and potentially tainted by Chaos due to his actions during the Second Aurelian Crusade, was banished on a Penitent Crusade to the Eye of Terror, one slated to last either until his death or the conclusion of one hundred years. Accompanied by the majority of the same strike force which won the First Aurelian Crusade and the Second, both he and the Strike Cruiser <i>Retribution</i> have not been seen or even heard of in the past eleven years.<br/>
<br/>
Captain Davian Thule, committed to a holy dreadnought after nearly being slain by tyranids and their poisons, his once noble and guiding presence gone save for rare moments of focus and clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Librarian Jonah Orion, one of the few of his kind to have battled the mighty Hive Mind of the Tyranids without falling or being slain. Only to meet his end at a traitors hands, though at least it was in that last final battle in the slaying of Kyras.<br/>
<br/>
So many more. Lost at the hands of Chaos and Xenos and...and their own brothers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, so few remain.<br/>
<br/>
But they will have to be enough, for now. For while the Chapter's future is more than a little uncertain, the Imperium still needs its Space Marines. You cannot go so quietly into the night. You <i>defy</i> such a fate with every fiber of your being. From the shattered ruins and ashes you shall rise again, and as many times as need be. The Blood Ravens shall stand, and they shall fight, for anything else would be a disgrace to the God Emperor and the Unknown Primarch.<br/>
<br/>
And you, Gabriel Angelos, have had <i>enough</i> of disgrace. Of family and brothers falling to weakness, of worlds meant to be under your aegis being put to the flame. Of betrayals and dishonor. Of dark secrets and uncertainty. <b>No longer</b>. You teeter on the brink, but you will not falter. Not here. Not ever again.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Never again</i>.â€‹</div></div>
