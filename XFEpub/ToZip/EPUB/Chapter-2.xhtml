    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">So I'm Angy about the most recent chapter of MHA, so have this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Inko was in a tizzy, running around with her phone to her ear, having already tried Mitsuki and now moving onto the Tsubasas. Izuku had disappeared, not just from his room, where he was supposed to be getting ready for bed, but from the house entirely! Oh, what had happen-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Mom! Mom!" Inko whipped around to see Izuku run out of his bedroom with a huge smile on his face and dirt and scratches on his bare feet and pajamas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Where have you been!?" She demanded, rushing over to bundle Izuku into a worried hug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"My Quirk showed up, my Quirk showed up!" Izuku babbled, not really returning the hug as he jumped in place in her arms, "Watch, watch!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Izuku untangled himself from her arms, hand glowing with light and he punched out. Staggering with the exertion as the light from his fist seemed to hit an invisible wall and crack it. Inko reached out, bracing Izuku from falling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cracks in the air grew larger before chunks of air fell away and shattered like porcelain, leaving behind a tunneling void in their living room. Out of it, three heads with long blond hair poked out, staring around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Oh… Hi, Dug," Izuku said with a nervous laugh. Six eyes landed on him and seemed to flash in the light, before charging out of the portal and towards him, tearing up the floorboards as they went and revealed themselves. Izuku yelped and threw a black baseball sized ball that had suddenly appeared in his hand at the ground, "Blanket, help me!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Blanke-? What was that!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Out of the ball came a red light that quickly formed into the figure of a small green imp with red eyes, Izuku's All Might blanket wrapped around it like a cowl. The imp blinked, looking at "Dug" for a second, before spinning around and rushing behind Izuku's leg, or well, lower body, pulling the blanket closer around it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Lar!" It cried, and Izuku gave a sad warble. It was kind of cute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And then Dug continued his charge towards the two of them and Inko saw red. Reaching out with her Quirk, she grabbed the back of Dug's hair and pulled it towards her. The differences in it attempting to charge forwards and her pulling it sideways caused a sharp jerk before Dug was torn from the now thoroughly ruined floor and left thrashing in the air impotently. This was gonna be fun to explain to their Landlord.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Inko and Hisashi might actually end up buying that house they always dreamed of, if things went badly enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Inko caught Dug by the hair, which felt more like iron, lifting him until his three heads were eye level with her and snarled out, "Did you just try and hurt my son!?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Izuku watched Dug hang in the air. Mom stared at it with blazing eyes, hand gripping thrashing hair far enough away that the tiny claws on the bottom of each head, like a… a… what were they called, millionpede? couldn't hurt her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You're not gonna hurt him, right?" Izuku said, staring up at his Mom and Dug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to throw him back into the portal," Mom said, walking back towards it… just in time for someone else to step <i>out</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, keiki, you're gonna need to explain the portal thing to m- woah!" The Lady yelped as her foot fell into the hole Dug had made and sent her falling forwards, crashing into Inko and sending Dug flying through the air. Izuku bolted from his spot, feeling the back of his PJ's tear as Blanket's claws punched through them, and caught Dug, hitting into the counter back first. Owwww.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Are ya alrigh' Dug?" Izuku gritted out, feeling Dug's razor sharp feet against his gut. The three heads stared up at him like they were seeing him for the first time and the feet moved away from Izuku.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Sorry, sorry," the Lady scrambled up before offering a hand to Inko, helping her up, "I swear I was born with two left feet sometimes. Though, uh, having a hole in the middle of your floor doesn't help with that. Where did it come from? Is that a Dugtrio? Where'd you get a Dugtrio, cousin?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Came through the portal," Izuku said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Poor thing is probably scared witless," she cooed, pulling out a luxury ball and throwing it onto the ground underhand, "Roggenrola, use Sand Tomb on the ground please?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Out of the ball came a small pokemon shaped like a stone eye with legs. After a second to look around it, a fountain of sand erupted out of the eyehole, creating a small hill in their living room. The Lady picked up Dug and put him on the hill, where his legs quickly flailed to dig until his three heads were the only thing visible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Is that better?" She cooed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Trio."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I bet it is," she said, before looking up at Izuku and Inko, "Let's talk, ok?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia sat on the couch with Roggenrola in her lap, hand running along the craggily surface of his skin. Next to her, Blanket was playing with the pile of sand for Dugtrio experientially, pushing his claws into the grains and watching them shift with wide eyed wonder. He pulled out a small fist full of the gritty substance and brought it to his mouth in curiosity, even as Izuku started, "Blanke-"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Blanket poured the sand into his mouth, swishing it around like it was okolehao before his eyes lit up and he swallowed the sand. Pushing himself to his feet unsteadily, he lunged forwards and buried his snout in the sand and began to munch happily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Larvitar eats dirt," Olivia explained to the befuddled looking Izuku in stilted Kantonise. Thank the Tapu she had taken that as an elective in High School, it was really helping today. Izuku's mouth fell open in the sort of silent "oh" you could only get from a child, and he turned to his mother.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"We're gonna need to get dirt for Blanket," he said, in a way he probably thought was sagely. It caused his mother, who otherwise was staring at Olivia with tight lips, to quirk a smile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Blanket," she said, watching the Shiny Rock Skin pokemon burrow himself deeper and deeper into the sand, "did you name him?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah!" Izuku nodded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"And you want to keep him," she said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah," Izuku smiled broadly, swinging his legs back and forth, "isn't he cool, mom?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I suppose," she said, "We'll have to think about it. Talk to your dad."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olivia's smile shrank slightly. Yes, this wasn't Alola, where a child's first Pokemon was a cause for celebration. Some particularly rich families, like Kiawe's, threw lūʻau for the occasion. She was speaking as if she was thinking of separating Izuku and Blanket.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"How about we get to introductions," she said, smiling politely despite her inherent disapproval of the idea. She was the guest here, and it wasn't her place to tell the woman how to raise her child. If she refused to let Izuku keep Blanket, Olivia would hold onto him until he was old enough to make that decision himself. It was that easy, "I'm Oliva, the Kahuna of Akala island in the Alola region."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Inko blinked at the words, mind wracking. She didn't know an "Alola" or an "Akala", but she definitely recognized the younger woman's "Kahuna". Wasn't it used by Americans to mean a boss, taken from one of their states?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm Midoriya Inko," Inko greeted with a bow in response to the offered hand. The woman's smile shrank just a bit, and her hand dropped like she wasn't sure what to do with it, "Can I assume you met Izuku while he was…" using his Quirk, "...out?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah," Olivia said, frowning, "about that, which region is this? Kanto? Johto? Sinnoh?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"We're in Shizuoka," Inko informed her, blinking as Olivia gave a tired sigh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I was afraid of that. I've never heard of a Shizuoka Region," What. "Can you tell me any pokemon native to it?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Pokemon? I've never heard of a Pokemon before."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Blanket's a Pokemon," Izuku piped up then, looking like he was only half paying attention as he watched Blanket happily eat his way through the mound of sand. The imp was now half submerged in the pile, his stubby feet poking out into the air.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Yes," Olivia said, offering Izuku a smile that didn't seem patronizing but more… sisterly, "Blanket is a Larvitar, a type of pokemon found in the Alola region. Good job, Izuku!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, Olivia-san!" Izuku chirped, to a wince from Oliva.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Just call me Olivia, please, Izuku," Olivia said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ok, Olivia," Izuku said obediently, before going back to watching his desired pet dig itself deeper and deeper into the pile of sand with a look of fascination on his face. Inko… really didn't know what to think about it. She had half expected All Might to let slip that he owned a dog, and spend the rest of Izuku's childhood being badgered for one. Not… whatever a Larvitar was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I've never heard of a Pokemon before," Inko repeated, "or an Alola or Akala. Could you show me on a map where they are?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"If Alola and Akala are on your map," Olivia said seriously, "I will be very, very surprised. Your son has a power I've never seen, or heard of before."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Portal Quirks are rare," Inko agreed, frowning as Olivia blinked wildly and then said something that sent her world very nearly into a freefall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You know how you didn't know what a Pokemon was? I don't know what a "Quirk" is. Do you mind telling me?"<br/>
<br/>
