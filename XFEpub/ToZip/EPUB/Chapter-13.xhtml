<br/>
Markus was heading to the Shieldarm, a favourite tavern, after drills to meet up with some of the Watch. A few were veteran Greatswords, old comrades injured in Sylvania who still wanted to serve Stirland, and Markus wasn’t going to forget about them.<br/>
<br/>
He rounded the corner, dodged neatly to the left to avoid tripping over a stray cat, and ran right into a small figure exiting a shop. The package she was carrying flew from her arms and burst open, scattering books even as the cat tangled her robes and tripped the woman up. Robes. <i>Grey</i> robes.<br/>
<br/>
“Mat- Journeywoman Weber!” Markus extended his hand to help her up. “My apologies! I dodged the cat, but not your flanking attack.” The look Mathilde gave him from under her brim was... unreadable. “Cat. Of course. <span style="font-size: 0.750rem">RnldIhpyramsd</span>.” Markus didn’t catch the last bit.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you unhurt?” Mathilde stood and dusted herself off, but appeared uninjured. “Of course you are, my honorary Greatsword-in-training. Still, let me help you collect your books.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh. Oh! Umm, no, thankyou that’s not-“ Mathilde scrambled for her books, still somewhat in disarray.<br/>
<br/>
Markus already had an armful, but paused at this as he picked up another, taking a look at one for the first time. <i>The Witch and her Hunter 3: Trials By Night. </i>The cover had a rough print of a tall man in a tall hat with a very long rifle looking at a young woman who had raised her arms theatrically, as if to cast a spell. Or embrace him.<br/>
<br/>
“Ahh, your books, m’lady.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thankyou. Markus. Sir. I must be on my way, please don’t let me detain you.” Mathilde seemed a little flustered as she swept away, balancing her pile of books.<br/>

In the alley opposite, two reflective eyes gleamed, then it was dark once more.<br/>
