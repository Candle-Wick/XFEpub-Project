The Past and Present: Imperial Guard</b>â€‹</div> <br/>
The tinkle of wine glasses forged in secret crystal foundries that only the most secretive Tech-Priests of Angel Forge handcrafted over the course of ten years filled the air. The backdrop was that of a band famed throughout the whole of the Sector who played symphonies and works that were filled with sorrow and emotion at the state of their world, though throughout it all the relieved and cheerful laughter of the hive elite who had lived through the troubles of their world kept a steady pulsing beat. Food that would have made a lower class hive dweller kill his mother and father with a rusty spoon for a single taste were casually picked off of pure silver plates and popped into mouths. Clothing of such richness and cost that they could have bought food and housing for hundreds of families had flooded the dance floor along with their wearers.<br/>
<br/>
Lord General Pollux Castor found it all incredibly...boring. Distasteful, really, when he and his men could be busy rooting out the remaining traitors who had absconded with their ill-gotten gains from the arms depots into the bottoms of the hive cities, or dealing with the orks who lived down there as well. Or hunting down any remaining Eldar. Or hunting down the feral tyranids which could go on his trophy walls back on the ship. As it was, he could not refuse the invitation of the Governor of Meridian without going through more effort than he was willing to expend on the situation. Still...<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, <i>please</i>, Lord General Castor, what happened next?" asked the vapid young woman who had first accosted him.<br/>
<br/>
He was beginning to regret his choice. It wasn't that he disliked parties or high society, for goodness sake he <i>was</i> high society albeit from a word far in martial excess than this one. It was just...<br/>
<br/>
"Oh yes, <i>please</i>, good sir, regale us further with this tale of yours," asked the woman's...husband?<br/>
<br/>
Castor narrowed his eyes imperceptibly - by the standards of <i>these </i>people at the least - and allowed his mind to actually go beyond the usual auto-pilot as he looked at the man. The way he maintained his grip on the woman's arm, the minute tightness around his mouth, the various rings on his fingers...ah, but not one signifying marriage. Of course, marriage traditions varied from world to world, sector to sector, but the century old man was most certain of what his instincts and mind said. Not a husband at all, not even a fiance, but jealous all the same. Castor would have smiled, but that would have given the game away too easily. At <i>last</i>, he thought, something to actually <i>do</i>.<br/>
<br/>
"Why of course my Lady," he said with a bow, leaning down to kiss the top of her hand, "How could I refuse such a beauty."<br/>
<br/>
Hah! He could hear the grinding of teeth from here, though that was only due to his bionic and cybernetic improvements.<br/>
<br/>
"O-oh my..." the woman blushed, fluttering her eyelashes, wresting her arm from the suddenly tight grip of the man next to her. Castor hadn't even bothered to remember the man's name.<br/>
<br/>
"Well then," he straightened before sweeping his bionic arm out slowly, to draw them and the small crowd around them further in, "We tracked the Lictor for an entire week through the underbrush, the ten of us, all the while all around us the world heaved and snarled its defiance. Death worlds," he sniffed, "do not take kindly to outsiders. They do not take kindly to much of <i>anything</i>, really, but we could not allow the Lictor to return to the enemy lines with its hard gotten adaptations."<br/>
<br/>
And so he told the tale of one of his more impressive hunts, one of his favorites. Ah, the Crimson Claw, one of the few worthy adversaries he'd found in his lifetime as a hunter. With proper gestures and intonations, he made them gasp as he lost the first of the men accompanying him to the Lictor's treacherous biomechanisms, of how it set traps for them even as they set traps for <i>it</i>. How orks became a mere tool sent at each other, and how despite the monstrous xeno's appearance it was possessed of an almost <i>human</i> capacity for brutality and cleverness. He had respected that, and it more so when one of its deadly spines buried itself in his shoulder and its claws nearly decapitated him. They had hunted it through the jungle and out into the savannah, open territory where they would have been seen by anyone looking from either tyranid or Guard lines.<br/>
<br/>
One by one, the ones watching gasped, cried out, or alternatively laughed, as he continued the story to its final breathtaking conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
After all, how many men had ever run out of ammo and had to <i>beat</i> a Lictor to death? If he hadn't had his bionic arm...well.<br/>
<br/>
"Lord General Castor! I was wondering where you'd wandered off too," came a melodic voice, one he thankfully recognized. He was even <i>more</i> thankful that the woman's presence put the rest of the babbling crowd of nobles to stark and sudden blessed silence.<br/>
<br/>
"Governor Derosa!" he turned smoothly and bowed deeply at the waist, "Your beauteous presence does me honor."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, please do rise, Castor, there is no need for that," was her reply, amusement clear in her voice.<br/>
<br/>
Permission granted, he rose and quirked an eyebrow at the woman before him. Rising from the adjutant to the traitorous Vandis's former position, she was a slight enigma and outsider even to her own 'court', such as it was. Many had protested her ascension due to her bloodline or lack thereof, and Castor had personally executed many of the traitors who had joined Vandis simply out of protest for the woman being Governor. A critical eye scanned over her and he did not quite frown at what he found. She still openly retained the slightly bulkier yet technically more efficient implants and bionics which had allowed her to process and interact with the sheer volume of information that the lazy Vandis had levied onto her which more than likely offended the soft sensibilities of certain nobles, while her heavily armed guards made them wary. The...Castor blinked internally...<i>five</i> pistols she kept on her person only one of which was the larger gold plated bolt pistol at her side seemed a bit excessive but then again she had suffered no less than ten assassination attempts within the past few months.<br/>
<br/>
"My lady, is there something you needed?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why yes, actually. If we could have some space?" her gaze turned from warm to cold ice the moment it left his own, and the nobles surrounding them scurried away with surprising speed. Castor was unsure if any of them had ever actually had to <i>run</i> for anything in their lives. "Castor."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes?"<br/>
<br/>
"We have a problem," her voice turned serious, and so Castor decided to actually bring himself to full attention and readiness, all of his considerable attention and focus levied onto her.<br/>
<br/>
"What sort of problem?"<br/>
<br/>
"The <i>pirate</i> kind," she hissed, "Orks, specifically. I told you of the freebooter known as Kaptin Bluddflag?"<br/>
<br/>
"I recall the beast, a most uncouth fellow. One whom the elite amongst Meridian had used as a mercenary under Vandis's lazy eye I believe?"<br/>
<br/>
She nodded curtly, her expression only somewhat sour as they were still being watched. But Castor was more than savvy enough to recognize just how furious she actually was, especially at this range.<br/>
<br/>
"While you spent most of the Third Aurelian Crusade assisting Inquisitor Adrastia in quelling the rebels that had risen <i>again</i> - damned Black Legion - here on Meridian, the Guard on Calderis were slaughtered by a combination of Kyras's sycophants, feral tyranids, and the orks there. Unfortunately, it seems that at some point during the Crusade that a large Kill Kroozer carrying Bluddflag and his crew crashed into Calderis, we've only just found the site of the crash."<br/>
<br/>
Castor frowned again, and began stroking his chin.<br/>
<br/>
"Only just now?"<br/>
<br/>
"It was a Blood Raven, actually, Scout Sergeant Cyrus, who found it. Bluddflag is a menace, and disturbingly resourceful. As of yet he hasn't found a way off planet or shown up openly in the few settlements we have left there, which worries me quite a bit."<br/>
<br/>
"A patient ork...I've seen their type before. Most troublesome."<br/>
<br/>
Derosa ran a hand through her hair and sighed.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed. I came to ask you if you would be willing to lead the 10th there and put an end to him at all. The 1st Meridian Consolidated and the 85th Vendoland can remain here, and keep order, but-,"<br/>
<br/>
"Say no more!" Castor raised a hand, palm facing her, "I can do that, and shall do so happily. <span style="font-size: 0.625rem">Anything to leave this party...</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"What was that?"<br/>
<br/>
"Nothing, my dear Derosa, I...yes?" he paused to ask the breathless looking young guardsman who had run up to him.<br/>
<br/>
"My L-General- Lord General, General L-,"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes yes, what is it?" Castor raised a single imperious eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
"We have...we have new orders," the man nearly fumbled the dataslate, but managed to keep it secure in his hands before it dropped entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Eyebrow still raised, he quickly plucked it out of the younger man's hands and scanned it, expression growing more and more dour as he read.<br/>
<br/>
"I do not think I will much like this news, shall I," Derosa muttered.<br/>
<br/>
"No, my dear, I do not think you will. We are being recalled to Cadia. Apparently Chaos raiding parties have increased...well, quite a bit, out of the Eye while we've been here."<br/>
<br/>
The woman did not look quite scared, but she did pale a bit and her hands clenched slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"From the Eye...you don't mean," she began hoarsely but stopped herself from going any further.<br/>
<br/>
Castor looked at her, and breathed out slightly through his nose.<br/>
<br/>
"I do not know, but I do not much like the idea of it. I would recommend battening down the hatches, my lady. Perhaps the Blood Ravens can take care of your Kaptin problem, as we cannot."<br/>
<br/>
And that was it. Within hours the orders had spread out, and the Cadian 10th were heading towards the space ports. The Lord General himself had a drop ship take him back to the waiting fleet above almost immediately, barking orders and prepping for departure. The whole of the while, he wondered sardonically if perhaps he should have wished the God Emperor to walk again, rather than more excitement. After all, the idea of a 13th Black Crusade was most certainly more excitement than he ever wanted or needed. He could only hope that Merrick, that hardy little fellow, would provide a good enough commander without him. When the ships passed by the Blood Ravens, the whole of the remainder of their fleet hovering protectively atop Calderis, he did not wish them luck.<br/>
<br/>
He was getting a feeling in his gut that he would need every scrap of luck he had for what might be coming.</div>
