“WE RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!”<br/>
<br/>
It was an exhilarating call that was taken up by hundreds of throats as the gleeful rumble and roar of assault bikes came to life. From exhaust pipes burst multi-colored smoke and fire that twisted sensually in the air, scented with all a manner of things natural and unnatural. Creatures of the warp that had long been bound to engines and metal awoke once more and happily stretched their unnatural presences throughout the frames of the once noble vehicles to shape metal and bone alike into horrors of speed and destruction. Some had once been originally crafted in the foundries of Mars, before being corrupted by those who rode them. Others had been born with their tires and armor plating inscribed with the symbols of Chaos by those of the Dark Mechanicus who had formed them from their own maddened designs.<br/>
<br/>
Chemical injectors activated in the armors of many, sending exhilarating cocktails of all a manner of substances into transhuman veins. Of energy, of pleasure, of pain, all of which in truth came to mean the same thing in the demented minds of the riders. Lances of forsaken steel were unfurled as were power swords and axes for whom the very power fields themselves were giggled and laughed in echoes of the Prince of Excess. At the same time, injectors plunged forth accelerants into the already taxed engines and fuel containers of their vehicles, accepted in with shuddering joy by the living bikes. Daemons yowled and cooed as they began to rumble near instantly at speeds as to be literally breakneck for a mere mortal human being.<br/>
<br/>
At their head, and the one who had given the call up in the first place, rode the greatest of their number. His bike was bigger, as was the corrupted being who still kept the form of the marine he had once been. Held aloft with one hand was a blade which erupted in blazing purple and pink flames that scorched the soul and blinded the human eye simply to look upon its glory. The assault bike had long become one with him, and so with all of his power it flew ahead – literally so – carving a trench into the earth beneath it that dared to try and support an assault bike of such unholy potency. Six hundred and six bikes erupted forth and charged across the wasteland that was left of territory that had been won and lost again and again between the forces of Chaos and the Imperium for years.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">========================================​</div> <br/>
“FOR THE EMPEROR!”<br/>
<br/>
For the death of Khajog Khan, only the complete and utter destruction of the one responsible for his death would allow his spirit to return to his home. For the death of such a hero, the White Scars could do no less than commit to such an action with all the ferocity granted to them by their Primarch-Father. And yet, for all that they so greatly desired the death of the Sorcerer Zaraphiston, the sudden invasion of Huron Blackheart upon their homeworld demanded the return of all but a handful of their brothers across the galaxy. All but a handful would not be nearly enough to chase their hated foe across the pockmarked and scarred plains of Cadia.<br/>
<br/>
But there were more than just White Scars upon the world. Their successors had come as well, heeding the call to face the Despoiler, and now they had been gathered under one of the most unlikely of leaders for the Adeptus Astartes. The Mantis Warriors, the Marauders, the Rampagers, and the Storm Lords together rode forth on their assault bikes not behind one of their own, but by one who served the Imperium all the same. For upon a bike that she had procured, whose very color and shape had seemed to shift beneath her, rode the Living Saint Celestine, her own blazing blade held high. Beneath her, steel looked as if it had become glowing white marble, gold glimmering with literal holy fury and protection, while the bike itself thundered forth at speeds undreamed of an unmodified machine. While her words to those distant sons of the Khan were for their ears alone, none could question the sight of Celestine charging out at the head of a band of hundreds, all riding along behind her, at some unseen and unknown vision that she had received in order to face one of the greatest mobile assets upon Cadia’s surface that Abbadon possessed.<br/>
<br/>
The White Scars may have been forced to retreat to protect Chogoris, yet such was the violence in the war cries of their Successors that it was as if the spirit of Khajog Khan and his Brotherhood were called back to the physical realm to ride once more against the damned servants of Chaos. And, if one were to say that they actually physically saw such things come to the fore, ghastly phantoms bearing the wounds of their deaths atop bikes that plumed invisible smoke yet thundered all the same, they were stalwartly ignored. And none would speak of seeing what appeared to be Khajog Khan, his armor turned black and encrusted with bone and flame, riding atop his own bike just behind and to the left of Saint Celestine.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================<br/>​</div>When the two masses of assault bikes truly sighted each other, their leaders had but eyes only for each other. Doomrider howled once more, and gunned his bike to an impossible further magnitude of speed while Saint Celestine’s changed bike roared forward with the same fury. But for one there was the inhuman roar of the eldritch being and his vehicle acting in one, the other was a gloried hymn to the God-Emperor and the woman who called out her own curses to the servant of Chaos. In something that harkened back to the eldest days of Ancient Terra when men rode in grand cavalry charges against one another in the long-forgotten nations who favored such actions, they clashed.<br/>
<br/>
Dozens died in the opening seconds, as the Saint and Daemon Prince clashed for the first time, dragging their bikes in bone-shattering speeds to turn on a dime so that they could exchange blows again and again at speeds beyond even most astartes. And yet more charged forward from behind them, striking at each other. Chains of frag grenade and krak grenade explosives tossed from bandoliers shattered the bikes of Chaos while spikes and thrown lances of daemon-tainted black iron impaled loyal sons of the Emperor through their bikes before exploding within them to remove even the potential of recovering gene-seed. Some slew others on the first pass, before wheeling about only to be killed from behind by yet more ranks of riders from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
“I will eat your heart and wear your wings as ornaments!” a mouth mutated upon Doomrider’s shoulder simply to be able to scream even louder with more volume.<br/>
<br/>
Celestine replied not with words but with her blade, twisting such that her wings flashed and she was suddenly horizontal and the wheels ran against the immaterial while the bike continued to thrum forward. Doomrider screamed in outrage as a gouge was driven deep into his shoulder, the holy blade sending his daemonic flesh screeching as ichor spilled forth from a wound that did not heal as it should have. Taunts left the paradoxically addled yet crystal clear mind in favor of driving its own bike to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
As the riders of Chaos clashed with those of the Imperium below, in a seemingly endless quicksilver-fast exchanges of blows did Daemon Prince and Living Saint rise into the air atop their bikes, held aloft by powers beyond mortal ken. A slit along Celestine’s cheek was struck bearing intoxicating poisons of death and pleasure in equal measure. The Ardent Blade stabbed deep into Doomrider’s stomach, though only managed outwardly at least to make the daemon cackle in twisted pleasure. Again and again they clashed, as nearly equally matched as any could see. Above the rising dust cloud as riders slew each other in great numbers, they rose higher and higher until the twinned lights of their great beings radiated in the Warp and in the Materium in equal measure that could be seen for a mile around.<br/>
<br/>
Alone, the God of Perfection’s frenzied servant would have locked itself against Saint Celestine for an incomprehensible and unknowable amount of time. For all of her skill, she was matched in this and in her purpose despite the tenuous and rapidly changing tides of the Warp throughout the Cadian Sector. None of the other servants of Chaos below, however, had been granted that which Doomrider possessed. And it would be folly to assume that one who served Slaanesh in all things would so easily give out what they found to be theirs in greed.<br/>
<br/>
Yet.<br/>
<br/>
The Saint Celestine was not alone.<br/>
<br/>
For rising from the ash and smoke of over a thousand individual clashing astartes of pure nature and not, rose those who had died and lived again under the grace of the God-Emperor. The Germinae Superia upon their jump packs leapt for the heavens, and their blades and hearts burned with that same holy light. Where there was one blade of holy light there were three, where there were was but one target there were three. Where one foe matched Doomrider at the height of his powers so far from the pylons upon the surface of the world, three overcame him. It was not a slow death, as would be an affront to Slaanesh and the God-Emperor alike when better things yet waited ahead. When death came, it came fast.<br/>
<br/>
The heart, the brain, the spine, all stabbed and cut apart without pity, without mercy, and with the most extreme of hatred of prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
Doomrider screamed one final time before he was burnt to ash before the light of the Emperor’s servants that vaporized him from the inside out in an explosion of gold and white that seared the coronas of many of those watching.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==================================<br/>​</div>“No!” Zaraphiston screamed in outrage as he saw what was meant to be one of his protectors as he went about his work died at the hands of the awful <i>thing</i> which burned with the light of a God he denied with his every fiber.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he was unable to do much more than protest it verbally before frantically returning to working the ritual. Everything upon the planet was harder to work through the warp here, and he knew precisely why yet had not the forces to deal with it at the moment. But he would be able to, and soon. With great curls of his fists and will, he stirred and rent the Great Ocean about him for his work, symbols burning into the air itself as if upon stone that glorified the powers of Chaos and that of the Changer of Ways.<br/>
<br/>
“Foolish daemon, for but a chance at that abomination,” he muttered to himself as he rapidly plunged a knife down into the chest of a screaming Colonel of the Imperial Guard who had thought turning traitor would assure him his survival against Chaos, “I should have known they would be too unreliable. But no matter. Soon enough-,”<br/>
<br/>
And then he tilted his head so that the silent blade which had almost cut into his skull passed only through the air and absentmindedly blasted a gout of warpfire to burn the assassin’s body down to the skeleton beneath. Before the Eldar could finish falling he reached forward and grasped the soulstone upon the chest, and clenched it with his fist. A small bit more of power and another screaming soul sent into the gullet of the Chaos Gods. If anything the foolish xenos would aid him in this to the point that – he dodged again and with enough frustration and fury to burn a planet down to the core beneath he turned away from his desperate ritual.<br/>
<br/>
“Foolish creatures,” he growled, even as the images of yet more of the Eldar resolved out of thin air. “You cannot stop me from completing my work, only delaying me from my success!”<br/>
<br/>
Harlequins led them. Of course it would be Harlequins and whatever deluded eldar decided to follow such creatures.<br/>
<br/>
“Aetaos'Rau'Keres must not be summoned to this world,” replied the leader, and then the battle was begun.<br/>
<br/>
They danced in and out of his view yet such was the power held within his mind and his soul that blasts of fire, frost, lightning, and purest force poured from his frame in all directions. Sometimes he saw one of the eldar fall, other times they danced out of the way. All the while wraithbone weapons stabbed and cut and tore at him. Behind him, he screamed in outrage as one of the symbols which had cost nine thousand souls simply to carve into the fabric of the materium was smudged out and removed. His mental commands sent his Rubric Marines crashing in from outside to battle against the eldar from two sides, and yet to his consternation and the fact that he <i>knew</i> he had slain a dozen of them yet more seemed to appear. Whether some were material and others but their inscrutable devices and holo-clones were beyond him to tell in this moment.<br/>
<br/>
“Gagh!” he fell to a knee as he felt the sting of a tube stab into the flesh of his neck, ejecting the high-tensile monofilament wire within to uncoil and shred his insides.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath his will, flesh began to knit as best as it was able, his mind commanding his body to function beyond the damage. Yet as he rose again, and this time certainly slew one of the Harlequins as he tore the heart from the female alien’s chest and incinerated it, another tube found itself pressed into the very palm of his bare hand which had been left unarmored so that he could bleed it for the ritual elements. Again, the monofilament erupted in him, his entire arm liquefied and part of his chest to his indignant scream. This time, Zaraphiston could not manage to rise up from his knees, the pain of his body blooming through the nerves his body yet retained in levels he had not felt in but direst of dealings with the most horrific of daemons.<br/>
<br/>
Another tube, this time into his neck into his chest. A series of neuro disruptors blasted into him, reducing even one of the greatest of sorcerers to ever be born to the Thousand Sons before he swore allegiance to Abbadon to his one remaining hand as his largely liquid and offal-filled armor as warp energies swirled to perform as best as able as the organs no longer present.  Zaraphiston screamed in the most honest pain he had since the fall of Prospero, this time at the hands of a gleeful looking Eldar who bore nether Harlequin mask nor soulstone, his black spiked armor and very flesh seeming to gleam and smooth out the cracks of age at the pain expressed by the astartes at their feet.<br/>
<br/>
But before the final blow was struck, and it most certainly would have been final, the eldar vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Zaraphiston gurgled as the greatest of his attentions focused on forming his flesh out of sheer warpstuff once more, managing to reform an arm if one covered in talons and feathers of blue and black as he struggled to stand, the monofilament wire still coiling inside of him as the scrapped his innards raw. It was only then that he felt the explosions reaching him, and looked up through the one eye he had managed to restore at the sight of his entire appropriated fortress falling down around him. Artillery fire slammed into walls built to keep Chaos out and then to protect Chaos. And through the gates, he saw through a slowly regrowing right eye that split itself into nine within the same socket a series of bike squads led by space marines of the Imperium.<br/>
<br/>
“There he lies,” came an echoing voice that nonetheless forced him back with the power of its light, and he gazed then at the tip of the Ardent Blade and then upwards at the Saint Celestine. “The vile monster.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then vengeance…,” rasped an impossible voice, “Is mine.”<br/>
<br/>
Zaraphiston stared uncomprehending at the marine wreathed in bone and flame, eye sockets blazing with ghostly light, who stepped forward from next to the Saint. In his hands he bore a scimitar of the White Scars, wreathed in a light that almost matched that of the Saints if darker in its fury and purpose.<br/>
<br/>
“For my brothers, and for my soul, I claim <i>yours!”</i> screamed the ghost, and then the great sorcerer Zaraphiston who was advisor to Abbadon the Despoiler died, cleaved in half to release the abbatoir within his armor to splash out along the ground before even that too was set in holy flame.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the battles on Cadia and elsewhere throughout the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade raged on.</div>
