    <h2>Waaagh Birdmuncha, Part 2</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] FIRST LINE: Caldera
[*] SECOND LINE: Hold
[*] THIRD LINE: Eastern Valley



"The Wyvern Caves would certainly be defensible, but it means taking our siege weaponry out of the picture because we wouldn't be able to pull it back to the second line fast enough," you say. "In this case, I think we should play to the strengths of the Dwarves. Let as many into the Caldera as we practically can, then turn the Eye of Gazul on the westernmost three-quarters and force the surviving greenskins to linger in the fields of fire from the Citadel and the Sentinels."

"The Citadel can hold," King Belegar says once more. "But Karagril and Mhonar..."

"Can be fortified. A single avenue of attack they have to excavate first while under constant fire, and then they have to wade up a stream of crossbow bolts just to encounter a Dwarven shieldwall. If there's any part of this adventure where the traditional Dwarven tactics should be applied, it's here." There's a series of thoughtful nods in response.

"Karagril's entrance has the mounting points for thirty grapecannons," Prince Gotri says.

"If we reinforce the Miners with Clan Huzkul, now they've got handguns and shields..." Dreng says thoughtfully.

King Kazador is nodding. "My lot will take Mhonar, then," he says. "Every one of them's at least passable with a crossbow."

"We could move the cannon into Mhonar-" Prince Gotri says.

"They'll be more useful above-ground, blasting holes in any surprises. Besides, I'm still not used to them," King Kazador says bluntly. "Peel off as many Bolt Throwers as can usefully fit in the Mhonar entrance, that'll do us."

"That leaves the Citadel for us," Princess Edda says.

"The Fieldwardens and the Besiegers too," King Belegar says. "And, of course..." he says leadingly, looking to Thorek and Kragg.

"Gyrocopters will shift my Anvil to one of the towers at first light," Thorek says.

"And mine's already atop the other," Kragg says, and you're fairly sure only the Waaagh on the horizon keeps Thorek from taking it as a barb.

"We'll keep the Undumgi within Kvinn-Wyr for now," King Belegar says. "They can support a fall-back if necessary. I'll put Angrund in the Karagril-Karag Lhune Underway for the same purpose."

"And we'll put every other bit of siege weaponry we can in the Citadel," Prince Gotri says. "And the Sentinels, and the Caldera rim north of the Citadel."

You've been editing the projection above on the fly as the discussion went on, faintly blobby depictions of Clan sigils and siege weapons taking their place in the MAP. "I take it you'll be manning the Eye yourself, Master Weber?" King Belegar asks.

"At least for the first firing, to make any Shamans regret attempting to stop me," you say. "After the greenskins have learned where not to tread, I'll leave it under manual fire and see where I might otherwise contribute."

Though orders for the fortifications and preparations went out soon after the broad scope of the defence was decided on, the minor details take hours more to hash out. By the time the meeting draws to a close, the sun is lurking somewhere to the east, not yet visible but perceivable as Ulgu waxes in strength in anticipation of the coming dawn. You scavenge up some breakfast, which is not a difficult task this close to a Halfling garrison, and wait for the sky to lighten enough for Prince Gotri's gyrocopters to scout the Waaagh and bring back word.

"Well?" King Belegar says, voicing the impatience the rest of you share as you cluster around the landing site by the Citadel.

"If they weren't scattered, I'd guess they bunked down overnight instead of continuing to march," Prince Gotri says, prying the flying goggles off his face. "They're at least six hours out, and about one in five are scattered to the winds. And they're having a really bad time of it, because there's a lot of Goblin Wolf Riders picking off whoever they can."

"Grey or yellow on their iconography?" King Belegar asks.

"Grey."

"Da Howlaz, then. No love lost between mountain Orcs and Badlands Goblins."

"They've got a lot of Pump Wagons, the Waaagh. Big ones, too. About forty or so, seems like every Big Boss has one."

"Won't do them much good underground," King Belegar says.

"Doubt they'll prove much of an obstacle to Gazul, either," you say.

---

With the Waaagh not arriving until past lunchtime, you've got time enough to add to your preparations. You'd earlier strongly considered spending some time with Gunnars to try to reach a better understanding of the Ancestor-God whose fire you were to wield, but perhaps the equation changes with the sun in the sky and the Waaagh's every movement tracked by gyrocopters.
The one with the most votes will win.

[ ] Hold a ceremony to Ranald with the Undumgi once more.
[ ] Spend time with your fellow wizards as you all prepare for war.
[ ] Meditate with Gunnars to attempt to attune yourself with Gazul.
[ ] Meditate to attune yourself to Ulgu.

[ ] Scout the Waaagh from the air for yourself, to identify the best targets for the Eye.
[ ] Attack and further disperse some of the scattered greenskins.
This will make it impossible for some to rejoin the Waaagh, and make them easy prey for Da Howlaz.
[ ] Attempt to contact Da Howlaz to induce them to harry the Waaagh as much as possible.
[ ] Attempt to assassinate Warboss Birdmuncha the Really Zoggin' Big.
[ ] Attempt to identify and assassinate the Shamans amongst the Waaagh.


There's sure to be time left over as well, with nothing to do as the enemy approaches but attempt to distract yourself with company. Who will you seek out?
The two with the most votes will win. This is essentially a mini social turn, and no mechanical advantage will result.

- There will be a two hour moratorium. Voting will not be in plan format.
- With this taking place during daylight hours, I decided it best to put it up to a vote instead of just going with the number three choice from the previous vote, which was for night-time actions. Have a mini social turn to take the sting out of relitigation.
