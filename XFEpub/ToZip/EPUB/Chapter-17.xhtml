    <h2>Interlude - Counterespionage in Eagle Castle 3</h2>
[*] Our main priority is defending the leadership of Stirland. As above, but also find a way to get a message to Wilhelmina, telling her to seek safety.
-[*] Berthold was me. I may have panicked and tried to attract Marcus' attention with a Magic Dart. I am not accustomed to running around in my underwear alright.

It would be so very easy, you think to yourself, to just keep your mouth shut and let the misconception go. But if they think that Berthold being knocked out was enemy activity, it would lead them to misread the situation and make tactical errors.

You have a duty to your liege.

"The attack on Berthold wasn't an attack," you blurt out, and both heads swivel to you. "I was trying to get Markus' attention without going out into the courtyard by bouncing a magic dart off his armour, and accidentally got Berthold in the head."

They stare at you, wordless. The moment stretches on. You shift from foot to foot, looking down at the floor, and then glance up at the faces staring at you. Van Hal's look is the resigned disbelief you've seen from him a few times now, but Markus' disappointment hurts.

"Okay," Van Hal finally says, his voice strained. "That changes things. Is there any indication that there's other infiltrators, and if so, that they've been activated?"

"There was a second infiltrator trying to break into the room I left the corpse of the first in," you say. "I knocked her out and then locked her into it. I think she may have been a lookout for the man I was interviewing."

"Then any other infiltrators may not yet realize that it's now or never," Markus says. "Your Grace, your safety has to be our first priority in this. It's very likely that you're their target."

"Not necessarily the only target, though," you say, and Van Hal's eyes narrow as he grasps what you're getting at. He looks between the two of you, then makes a decision.

"Markus, go to the barracks. Send half of the Greatswords to the Archives, and half to the Chapel, with messages telling Wilhelmina and Kasmir that the castle has been infiltrated and they may be attacked. Then join your men at the gatehouse and await the return of Gustav and the rest of the Greatswords - when they get here, take command and secure the castle."

"Yes, your Grace." He bangs his fist against his chest in a salute, bows, and leaves.

Weaving the locking enchantment into the door took a few seconds. Shifting Van Hal's writing desk over in front of the door took most of a minute. You transferred a set of curios and keepsakes off one set of shelves, and then overturned them to act as cover, just in case - that took a couple more minutes.

You have approximately fifty-seven minutes left of waiting barricaded in a room with your liege while wearing nothing but your wizard hat and smallclothes.

[ ] Stand there awkwardly for fifty-seven minutes.
[ ] Deliver your report regarding the Marshal candidates (write in the report)
[ ] Challenge Van Hal to a spar
[ ] Find Van Hal's bottle of Ostland brandy and drink away the awkwardness
[ ] Other (write in)
