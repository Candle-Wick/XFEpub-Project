    <h2>Jumped-Up Peasant</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">One of the things Elector Count Abelhelm Van Hal genuinely appreciates about Stirland is the minimal amount of politicking he's required to participate in. There's still much more than he finds palatable, but for the most part his duties are as follows: keep Stirland from going the way of Sylvania, and keep Sylvania from getting any worse. Stirland's nobles are generally happy to let alone if left alone, and the occasional abomination wandering in from Sylvania reminds them why they pay taxes. What little there is apart from that, his advisors handle, with his signature or public input required here or there.<br/>
<br/>
It makes occasions like this all the more painful for their rarity.<br/>
<br/>
In the time he's been in Stirland, Abelhelm has had little to say to his fellow Elector Counts. He's been sounding out the idea of a joint excursion into Sylvania, but the correspondence has progressed slowly. He knows who they are, would offer them aid in time of dire need, and until now that had been sufficient. Then this. A gathering of the most powerful people in the Empire, none of whom Abelhelm has gotten to know over the past few years.<br/>
<br/>
He grits his teeth and mingles for a while, trying not to constantly bring the conversation back to the many, many undead he's had to slay since taking responsibility for Stirland. Something about viscera makes the other nobles go grey in the face, and he's trying to maintain neutral relations at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
After a few hours, however, he needs something familiar. Something sane, and safe from this Count or that introducing him to their unmarried daughters (or their dashing young son in one case, something he did not understand the purpose of until hours later). He casts about for someone he knows-- Anton, perhaps, or Mathilde if she hasn't slipped away yet. Anton, as his diplomat, was a natural choice to bring along, and Mathilde wriggled her way into going, as she does.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't find the Grey Wizard, though he does find talk <i>of</i> her.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you hear that the Elector Count of Stirland knighted his <i>Grey Wizard</i>?" One noble 'whispers' to another, quite loud enough to carry.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph," the second snorts, "nothing more than a jumped-up peasant."<br/>
<br/>
Abelhelm pauses. This is the sort of political nonsense he doesn't know what to do with. Should he step in? Is it his name at stake here as well, since he knighted her? Does it genuinely matter what a pair of unimportant nobles - he doesn't recognize them on sight, therefore they can't be that important - discuss off-hand? Would it set off certain implications if he jumps to Weber's defense?<br/>
<br/>
"That's <i>Dame</i> Jumped-Up Peasant, milord."<br/>
<br/>
The two nobles twitch, heads snapping to face Weber herself, who is smiling with a mouth full of teeth that promise very unpleasant things in their future. Abelhelm smothers a laugh, and continues on his way. He should have known she could take care of herself.</div>
