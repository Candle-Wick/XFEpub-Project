    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Interlude (two hours ago)</h2>
King Belegar sighs, lifting his incomplete crown to wipe the sweat from his forehead. The Border Princes was just far enough from anarchy to be more difficult to work with than if it was pure chaos, and for everyone that knew something and was willing to share, there were ten that knew nothing but would lie to you to try to make trouble for those they see as their enemies, which normally amounted to some other polity no more than ten minutes of brisk walking away. Eventually his questions had led him and his escorts to the headwaters of the Howling River, near the western edge of Mad Dog Pass. The 'Princes' there had become very used to collecting tolls from merchants that passed through it when it was the safest of the three, and with the new route through Ulrikadrin, Death Pass had very much overtaken it as the passage of choice. It seems piracy was their idea of a solution to this.

Fortunately for them, they were as inept at piracy as they were at geopolitics, and they'd yet to manage anything that would earn them a Grudge. If they could find their hidden docks, they could destroy their shoddy galleys and intimidate them into not trying that sort of thing again, and according to King Byrrnoth, news would fly through the Border Princes at the speed of rumour that the Dwarf Kings presented a united front, and messing with the trade of any of them would draw the attention of all of them. Hopefully, this would forestall any thoughts of riverine piracy among the Border Princes, which would be important for making sure the Zhufbar Canal resulted in profit rather than disruption. But so far Belegar, his Hammerers, and the team of Barak Varr Rangers had found nothing but a lot of foothills and a few wary goats despite what more than a few manlings had said, and the only sign of life so far was the smoke of a fire they've been heading towards for the past half hour.

A final rise surrenders to the ceaseless trudge of Dwarven feet, and Belegar frowns for a moment as he concludes that a sole being at a fire is likely not part of the piracy problem, then smiles as he recognizes the normal-sized stature and long, white beard of a member of his people. "Ho, wyrtrommi," Belegar says, a hand raised in greeting.

"Ho, riki," the longbeard replies.

Belegar's smile widens. "Strollenskraten?"

The stranger returns the grin. "Strollenganden, debtrommit." Prospectors were notoriously independent, and a common saying among them is that 'the Karak belongs to the King, everywhere else belongs to the Prospectors'. Taking their casual nature seriously was a quick way to start a pointless fight, but matching them barb to barb was an entertaining way to pass an afternoon, and half of the way to earning their respect. Belegar reaches into a pocket under his beard and passes over a flask, the other half of the way.

The longbeard grins and takes a pull, then raises his eyebrows. "Not bad. Unusual bite to it," he says thoughtfully.

Belegar takes a seat on a stone by the fire, across from the one the longbeard was perched upon. "Halfling hops, but only zinti brewers. Dourbacks are settling matters before they move in."

"Ah, new beginnings." He takes another, more appreciative drink, then passes the flask back. "No wonder I didn't recognize the taste. Eight Peaks?"

"I have that honour."

"Been hearing interesting things from that way." The longbeard reaches into one of the many pouches on his belt and throws a handful of powder at the fire, turning it a vibrant blue. At Belegar's inquiring look, he inclines his head towards the horizon. "Someone's looking for you." Belegar follows it, lifting a hand to shield his eyes from the sun. Right at the edge of what is visible, there is a speck moving among the clouds.

"How did you-"

"Need sharp eyes out here," the prospector says vaguely. "Must be urgent, for them to be looking so hard."

"Must be," Belegar says, frowning. What has that wizard of his gotten up to now?

"From the state of that crown of yours, probably the sort of business that will see blood shed by nightfall."

A sigh. "I don't doubt it."

"Kind of business that could use another shield in the wall, I suppose."

Belegar turns back to the longbeard, taking him in. The years were worn into his face, but Dwarves just got harder as they aged, and his beard told of many years weathered. "I'll not turn away any willing to help."

"Well then," says the longbeard as he takes up his axe, sunlight glinting off Runes. "Let's see what tomorrow will bring."
