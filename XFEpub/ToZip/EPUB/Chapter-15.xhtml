    <h2>The Knight Witch Hunts 1: Beastmen, Goblins and Orcs, Oh My</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">Back cover blurb on a lightly-chewed copy of <i>The Knight Witch Hunts 1: Beastmen, Goblins and Orcs, Oh My.<br/>
</i><br/>
For her service, MAGDA WESSEN, talented WIZARD has graduated as the Empires youngest GREY MAGISTER, but still she guards her heart. The DARK PLOT that slew her Master in <i>The Witch and her Hunter 1</i>:<i> Murder Most Foul</i> (available from all good book sellers) has been revealed, but it’s DEPREDATIONS extended further than Magda could have ever imagined, into the IMPERIAL PALACE itself- with TRAGIC and UNSPEAKABLE consequences!<br/>
<br/>
With unrest rising across the Empire, Magda foresees dark times ahead, while her enemies- JEALOUS of her talent- manoeuvre the prominent KNIGHT-WIZARD into leading a band of Journeymen, including the precocious young Jade Wizard potionmaker CONSTANCE BREW (YA series available now!) on a PERILOUS mission deep into the WORLDS EDGE MOUNTAINS. But first, a dangerous journey through the BORDER PRINCES and BADLANDS awaits...<br/>
<br/>
Will Magda’s PURE HEART, SHADOW MAGIC and SWORD be enough to overcome the hordes of GREENSKINS and BEASTMEN and protect those she cares about? What DARK DEEDS will be done in the Empire while it’s BRAVEST PROTECTOR is in the distant Worlds Edge Mountains? And can ANYONE take up the challenge of replacing Magda’s LOST LOVE and opening her heart once more?<br/>
