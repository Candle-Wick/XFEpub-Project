The <i>Terminus Est</i> was one of the most powerful individual vessels ever forged by man. That was before it’s corruption and improvement by the delicate and caring touch of the Chaos God Nurgle. It’s rotting deck plates and rust covered hull had proved impervious to some of the greatest weapons every unleashed by any foe it had ever fought. To those weapons that managed to pierce it, to wound the ship in turn, even they could not possibly have dealt enough damage before pulsating swollen sinews of metal and flesh grew from nothingness and then calcified to patch holes and regrow flesh. It was, indeed, one of the most favored vessels of the Plaguefather in the entire galaxy, for it bore Typhus the Traveller himself at the head of the infamous and horrifying Plague Fleet.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>Terminus Est</i> had been impaled through the midsection, and like a great beast it thrashed. Yet like a great beast, it too would die. Pinned in place by the battle barge which had furiously struck it through the stomach, its claws of lascannon and fangs of plasma scratched viciously yet ultimately futilely against the weapon which had doomed it. For spewing from the weakening Imperial vessel came a great rain of drop pods that carried with them certain death. But it was not enough. Surely not enough for one of the greatest foes that the Imperium itself had ever faced and one of the eldest and known traitors of the Horus Heresy.<br/>
<br/>
It had cost two entire sector battle fleets for this. Three whole Subsectors of the entire Agripinaa Sector had burned for this. A million lives of Guardsmen, of Navy crewmen and serfs, had been exhausted to bring this battle into being. Countless more had been lost across the entire Sector and the rest of the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade as forces were ordered away from their battlefields and maneuvered to engineer this trap. Whispers of a Farseer of the Eldar appearing and speaking into the hearts and minds of certain Imperial Commanders were ruthlessly suppressed and ignored when one questioned the fortune of certain paths revealing themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But now, Ulthor burned. Every world within had been subject to Exterimatus at the hands of Lord Inquisitor Coteaz. The Plague Fleet was surrounded and the living infection upon reality was even now being burnt away. But to truly end it would require more than just fire, it would require a scalpel of finest make and deadliness to be plunged deep into the heart of the entire force. Or, as had been chosen, dozens of scalpels. As well as an utterly massive and singularly concentrated spear of indomitable force. For the Plague Fleet burned, but <i>Terminus Est</i> remained the greatest quarry that demanded death above all others.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">============================<br/>​</div>“I have heard your name before, Asterion Moloc,” Typhus wheezed as he rose from his throne, the Manreaper in his hands buzzing with joy at being unleashed once more upon those who had yet to accept Nurgle’s blessings.<br/>
<br/>
The hulking Chapter Master of the Minotaurs did not pause as he swept onto the bridge, slaying those defiant remaining Death Guard with contemptuous ease. Even as the denizens of the Destroyer Hive began to rise up from the bone spires of his very flesh.<br/>
<br/>
“Master of the Minotaurs," the Traveler gurgled as he stomped forward at a languid pace even as his ship shuddered in its death throes. "Satrap of the <i>Daedelos Krata</i>," he swept his daemon weapon into a guard position, "Bringer of Wrath, The Brazen Warlord,” the tainted marine spat a glob of acidic poison from one of the holes in his flesh that flies crept up from. "Spear of Judgement.”<br/>
<br/>
“Die, traitor,” Moloc replied simply.<br/>
<br/>
Yet even as Typhus began to charge, his ship screamed within his mind, and so with truly unnatural speed his bulk should not have been capable of granting, the devotee of Nurgle swept backwards as a series of blades tore their way through the floor. With an unintelligible gibbering scream the Eversor assassin finished tearing its way upwards before without a single pause leapt at Typhus where it immediately died just after scratching his armor.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Typhus uttered, his filmed and pus-filled eyes glaring at the motionless Moloc who had not yet moved once.<br/>
<br/>
It was, it seemed, to be a signal for another four Eversors to liberally rip their way through the flesh of Terminus Est which was far too busy screaming as ships around it began to bombard its hull and the battle barge of the Minotaurs which it had been impaled upon. The comfortable omniscience of all that occurred on his ship was gone from him, not simply because of its pain, but because…of other things. Suddenly the emptiness and utter numbness that the ship felt and thus he felt made more sense. For those gaping awful maws of nothingness <i>moved</i>.<br/>
<br/>
One, in fact, appeared behind Moloc. The Culexus Assassin twitched oddly as it stepped across the floor of the bridge. Before it’s very feet, the curling rot and decayed metal and flesh that made up the <i>Termins Est </i>were literally forced into utter mundanity. What the warp touched was forced clean, what was made wholly of it disappeared entirely in the presence of the horrifying <i>thing</i> which stood forward.<br/>
<br/>
“What is this!” Typhus snarled, his barely concealed fury at the Plague Fleet being torn apart unfurled now. “I shall slay you all in Nurgles name!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Prognosticars are ready, Moloc,” a new voice called out, audibly, as a blindingly pure light which struggled even now against the utter empty presence of the Culexus appeared, and to Typhus’s fury a squad of Grey Knights moved against him.<br/>
<br/>
“Hyperion,” Moloc greeted the Librarian while remaining motionless.<br/>
<br/>
“How…how is this possible!” Typhus roared as he unleashed himself, leaping forward to meet the spear of Moloc immediately even as daemons of Nurgle began to appear from the walls to assist their master.<br/>
<br/>
How could these things all have been concealed from his sight! Who would dare…who…<br/>
<br/>
“ELDAR!” he roared as he tore apart one of the Grey Knights with his manreaper, an Eversor leaping upon his back found its face and head eaten by a giggling nurgling which popped as a pimple from within the armor of the Traveler.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course! He could sense it now. Even now, the clouding upon his mind was lifting and the Warp itself resounded in kind as the xenos witch panicked at his focusing his own considerable psychic might upon them. With a great clenching of his fist, he felt the Farseer on their precious hidden ship on the other side of the planet they all fought over be snuffed out, so focused were they on him that their own defenses had been neglected.<br/>
<br/>
But it was too late, for Typhus, distracted as he had been for that one crucial instant.<br/>
<br/>
The canticles of the Grey Knights had been chanted all the while. The Culexus battered at his very being beyond the physical with its null weaponry, getting frustratingly close so that it’s negative psychic energies could tear at the infusion of all that Nurgle had granted him and shredding at his own mind. The Black Spear plunged into his hearts, and tore them out one after another before stabbing forth again and again with relentless and almost machine-like brutality by Moloc’s merciless hands. All the while, more Eversors appeared and applied themselves against the great and nigh-invulnerable bulk of Typhus.<br/>
<br/>
“You will all die with me,” he bellowed, managing to slay another of the Grey Knights as he felt their number throughout the ship chanting and channeling. “ALL OF YOU!”<br/>
<br/>
“That is acceptable to me,” Moloc grunted as he stabbed again into Typhus’ chest, this time spearing one of the nurglings hidden inside.<br/>
<br/>
And so <i>Terminus Est</i>, in the last of its unnatural life, screamed defiance and began to kill itself even faster if only to plunge its occupants all into the void and the warp alike as a final revenge.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
=========================================<br/>​</div>“27 Eversor Assassins, 4 Culexus Assassins, and 100 Grey Knights, all dead for this,” Coteaz grunted as he tossed the dataslate to the side and folded his hands behind his back to look up at the impassive Moloc. “Are we sure?”<br/>
<br/>
“We have confirmed it. The <i>Terminus Est</i> and the Plague Fleet have all been destroyed. The Eldar Farseer and her coven were located, all dead. Fungus had erupted from their insides and eaten them from within to without. ”<br/>
<br/>
“And of Typhus?”<br/>
<br/>
At that, the hulking Minotaurs Chapter Master shifted slightly. Almost a shrug. Almost.<br/>
<br/>
“A soul of his, so beloved by Nurgle, is likely to be reborn at some point or another if the Grey Knights failed to contain it and destroy it fully - though the Culexus should have ensured it. Yet for sure, even if he survived the injuries dealt to him, the ritual of the Grey Knights <i>should</i>,” Asterion emphasized the word, “Have banished him back into the warp for some time if all else failed.”<br/>
<br/>
The Inquisitor Lord nodded curtly before turning away and facing both his desk and the void through the windows beyond.<br/>
<br/>
“I heard that 300 of your brothers died in this assault as well. You have my condolences.”<br/>
<br/>
“They can and will be replaced. If our duty here is concluded, then the Minotaurs shall move on to their next target. The Black Spear thirsts for The Foresworn's heart," and here the Minotaur growled with a hatred strong enough to force the Lord Inquisitor's heart to pause for a moment before beating.<br/>
<br/>
"Good day, Chapter Master," Coteaz waved Moloc off and returned to contemplating the fate of the rest of the Sector while the rest of the Black Crusade raged on.<br/>
<br/>
Typhus the Traveler gone. His Plague Fleet obliterated. The <i>Terminus Est</i> fully destroyed, which in truth was more of the goal of the Grey Knights than killing its master. The ship was what ferried the traitor in the first place, and the destruction of its corrupted hull would do much for the morale of Imperial Navy forces the galaxy over. If anything, Coteaz was rather largely annoyed that it had cost him so much in favor and attention to the Officio Assassinorum to provide their servants in such numbers, and yet he knew that it was worth it to have removed such a piece from the board. For a time, at least. One could hope that the Grey Knights and Culexus working together would be enough, but he had been alive for far too long, seen far too much, to allow hope to be granted a place in his heart for matters such as this.</div>
