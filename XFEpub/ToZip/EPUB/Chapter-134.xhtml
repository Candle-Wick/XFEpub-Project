After giving your orders to the Rangers and having the Karak Izor Dwarves and the Besiegers take up the defensive positions abandoned by the Skaven, you summon your memorized MAP of the Trenches for King Kazador and leave command in his eminently capable hands. You've infiltrated the Trenches when the entirety of Clan Mors was inhabiting it and watching out for Eshin intruders, so under the present circumstances you see no reason why there'd be any obstacle at all to becoming terror itself to the remaining Skaven. The men and Dwarves watching you walk happily down the ramp into the Skaven warren see you enter a shadow cast by one of the cranes, and then they see no more.

Above, the Skaven were ready for an attack by the Eshin, and many of their preparations were useless or acted against them when it was Dwarves instead that attacked. Below, the hasty defences being thrown together by the rallied Skaven are made to defend against Dwarves, and once more they've erred. Against Dwarves, darkness was the ally of the Skaven. Against you, it absolutely is not. You slip effortlessly past the cordon and need only select your preferred target from the buffet of Skaven laid out for you.

Many who live above the ground believe that weather is known only to them, but in the massive cave networks of the Under-Empire the airs move according to their whimsy just as much as they do on the surface. The stillness of the air just inside the Trenches was just as eerie to the Skaven as it would be to surface-dwellers, and each of them fought the urge to squirm in discomfort as heat and humidity built around their massed bodies, the Musk of Fear hovering infuriatingly on the edge of scent. A few hours ago each of them feared a knife in the dark or a technosorcerous assault, paying no attention to the moribund Dwarves who had barely glanced west of the Citadel over the years.  The assaults on the Under-Karagril and Under-Citadel had come as a shock, and that they'd blitzed onwards with an attack on the Cavern of Stars itself went against everything they thought they knew of Dwarven strategy. Said knowledge also said that an immediate follow-up below was unlikely, and whispered prayers to the Horned Rat begged that once more the Dwarves would return to predictability.

"Beard-things do not act this way," went a hissed conversation among defenders. "Some Eshin trick, yes-yes?"

"Leftover Moulder," another suggested. "They know the Beard-things, perhaps they trick them, spite-attack us."

"Silence!" growled a Fangleader, and though all obeyed, the tension in the atmosphere rose even further; and with Skaven, it was no mere metaphor, and the sharp nose of a cunning leader could measure the mood of their underlings. "Beard-things are Beard-things," he says, his voice becoming wheedling. "They attack from front, always. Above, ready for Eshin, ready for Skryre. Now, we ready for Beard-things. Many messages sent to Warlord Sleek. We hold them off, Warlord Sleek returns, they are caught-trapped between us. We feed on them tonight."

None disagreed, but it was difficult to say if it was out of agreement or not wishing to become an example to encourage the others. Silence fell once more, the only noise the brush of a twitching tail against stone, and then-

"Stop that!" the Fangleader hissed at whoever it was scratching their claws against the stone, and one of the Skaven in the line turned, eyes glinting in the darkness. "Yes-yes, you. Eyes forward, or we will fight with full bellies."

All Skaven are ready to defend against betrayal, but betrayal rarely comes from directly in front, and only the Fangleader's reflexes saved him as the Skaven shrieked and threw himself forward, claws outstretched. A single blow cut the attacker down, and all eyes turned to stare at the rat that had seemingly gone berserk.

"Let this be an example," the Fangleader attempted halfheartedly, but like all others he was staring befuddled down at the dying Skaven. No musk of fear, no musk of battle, just sudden, insane attack. Why?

The answer would never come. The Fangleader had an instant in which he could have reacted as pain blossomed in his chest, and then a second, stronger thrust shoved the blade between two ribs and into his heart and he knew no more. The watching Skaven did not see the wound, as the chestplate the Fangleader wore blocked their gaze even as it posed no obstacle to the summoned dagger. All they saw was their leader crumple.

"Eshin!" came the whisper from a dozen mouths, and fear arced through the air, but none ran, not yet. They were Clan Mors, and they were destined to rule the Under-Empire. One of the few remaining Stormvermin approached cautiously, sniffing at the air, halberd swinging slowly back and forth as if searching for an invisible assailant.

"No," said the Stormvermin at last, eyes locked on the Fangleader's plumes. "No Eshin. Traitor-coward must have got lucky stab with spare knife."

A second later when he too crumpled to the ground, the remaining Skaven needed no further encouragement to give in to the overwhelming desire to flee.

The fleeing Skaven trailed the Musk of Fear behind them as they scattered in all directions, and throughout the other defensive positions Fangleaders did their best to keep increasingly scared Skaven under control as the Chieftain dispatched scouts to investigate the fallen position. One returned, gibbering in fear about blades in the dark, and the Chieftain lifted the unfortunate rat into the air, demanding answers. The silence he got in return was at first taken to be the scout being overwhelmed with fear. The realization that the scout was suffocating would have come far too late if there had been anything he could have done to stop it, but as it was, it came just in time for him to witness the tendrils of darkness release their grip on the dead scout's throat. Then he saw the darkness seem to part to reveal a man-thing, but this man-thing was wreathed in shadows and the Chieftain knew that it had come to feed on his soul.

There are few things more demoralizing to a force than the death of their commander, but their commander fleeing into the darkness shrieking is one of them.

By the time the Throng of Karak Azul marched down the spiralling ramp, the closest thing there was to resistance were those curled up into balls or wandering dazed through the tunnels, their minds completely addled by fear and Ulgu.

[Karak Azul vs the Trenches: Martial, 92+15+20(Thunderhorn)-10(Dark and Cramped)=117.]

You were only one person and could only be in one place at a time, so knots of resistance formed out of the fleeing Skaven faster than you could shatter them. King Kazador is not so limited; he has spent most of the last century transforming the Throng of Karak Azul into an extension of his will, and through it he reaches through the Trenches to crush any attempts by Clan Mors to reorganize. You feared there would be innumerable traps, and it turns out you were right to, but most ended up being blundered into by terrified Skaven and most of the rest were found by Rangers. There were still casualties, of course - there could be no military operation on this scale without them - but they were few and mostly minor. It takes less than an hour for the Trenches to fall.

When you first infiltrated the Trenches, it was a bustling fortress-town. When you did so more recently, it was significantly poorer and less populated. Now it seems like the arrival of the Dwarves is a mere formality, a full stop on the end of the measures Clan Mors has been driven to as it nears extinction. Every 'civilian' Skaven had been either armed or eaten, every clever device dismantled for enough scrap metal for one more sword or spear, every example of technosorcery dismantled for its fuel so it could become one more burst from a ratling gun, one more second of charge for a warp lightning cannon. Everything edible had been eaten, everything flammable had been thrown into the furnaces. Not even the banners bearing their circular sigil have escaped the flames. Everything that Clan Mors was had been poured into one final desperate strike at Clan Eshin. Though the world you know is better for there being one less Skaven Clan to torment it, part of you can't help but mourn.

You knew that there was one thing they'd never have eaten, and sure enough a Ranger leads you to one of the chambers that had been too closely guarded to approach on your earlier visits, and King Kazador falls in silently beside you, his face as grim as yours. The issue had been lurking in the back of your head ever since the stop-and-start war with the Skaven had begun in the Karak, and now it was finally here, and you were the one in ultimate authority. The Breeders of Clan Mors; the Rat Mothers. You refuse to take a moment to collect yourself, and instead push right through the heavy steel door, still slick with the blood of the Skaven that had died defending it.

Imperial accounts speak of filth and squalor, but the room inside is fastidiously clean. Bare stone is covered by a patchwork of furs, each bearing innumerable marks of being stained and then scrubbed as clean as it could be made. And scattered throughout the room are perhaps fifty of the enormous creatures that give birth to the innumerable hordes of the Skaven, the Rat Mothers. They were born differing from their brothers in only one way, and those selected to be cursed or blessed with the most important role in the Under-Empire were transformed by magic and science and the unholy combination of the two. The result is the creatures before you, each longer than you are tall and so bloated that their withered limbs can't even attempt to carry their weight, forever kept in a pliant haze by warpstone-infused drugs. Surrounding them, utterly terrified but still standing between you and their charges, are the Skaven that keep the Rat Mothers fed and clean and drugged. Imperial writings say they are castrated males, the few Skaven sources you've seen suggest they may instead be untransformed females. Perhaps it varies from Clan to Clan. Whatever the case, it's irrelevant to the matter at hand.

"No children, the Rangers say," says Kazador beside you, his voice heavy. "Mors chose to feed their current troops instead of adding more, I suppose. That's a mercy. Ungrown greenskins are still the same vile creatures, but I'm told that infant Skaven have yet to learn cruelty." You think of Johann's pets, and suspect that he's correct. "Still..."

"No will, no choice, not even awareness," you say faintly.

He nods. "It's easier with the regular Moulder-beasts. At least then they're trying to kill you."

A cocktail of medicines and potions maintains the unnatural metabolism and pliancy of the Skaven Breeders. Those that know where they're kept, how they're made, and the dosages to be administered either died defending the Trenches or are locked in battle with Clan Eshin. In the coming days, each of these Rat Mothers will regain their senses for the first time in years or even decades as their bodies begin to fail in a hundred different ways, each of them agonizing. They are as doomed as every other Skaven here. All that remains is the details.

In a few moments, one of you is going to tell the other to leave. You're still not sure whether it's going to be you.
