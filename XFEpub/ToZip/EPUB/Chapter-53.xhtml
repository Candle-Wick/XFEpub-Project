<b>015.M42 Interlude: Hunters At Home</b>​</div> <br/>
A single Explorator Fleet is built to withstand almost any foe in the whole of the galaxy. Yet when Explorator Fleet ZX–23.Z returned from the Ghoul Stars, it bore grievous and terrible wounds. Of the many cruisers and escorts which were in truth all but companions of the greater Ark Mechanicus <i>Benevolence Of The Omnissiah </i>which had been crafted from a reclaimed Space Hulk, few remained. Of the Ark Mechanicus itself, vast channels of damage had been driven into its hull, trenches that were almost a mile long in one instance from scarring of vastly powerful weaponry. The sheer absence of other ships was a sign in and of itself of the difficulties and dangers faced.<br/>
<br/>
Yet when the <i>Benevolence</i> arrived above its home, wearied and hurt, it was welcomed back with the most passionate of celebrations that the cold logic that its priests could manage. Consecrated oils and the most holy of cleansing materials were used, whole manufactorums turned towards creating materials and tools to use them in repairing the survivors of the expedition. Its Explorator, for all that they were almost entirely machine, was clearly wearied beyond belief. As they tromped down, all eight of their mechanical legs still bore scars and points of damage despite obvious maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
“Valens,” buzzed Fabricator-General Phokas, a nod of respect for one of the most noble of tech-priest vocations.<br/>
<br/>
“Phokas,” the mono-tone binary cant was returned, the Explorator bowing deeply enough to obscure the multiple eyes that gleamed green beneath its hood.<br/>
<br/>
“You have returned…and so wounded as well.”<br/>
<br/>
“Many dead worlds, once claimed by humanity before the Great Crusade and Times of Woe,” Valens returned, head rising slightly, “Were claimed by xenos and stranger things.”<br/>
<br/>
But the question of course…<br/>
<br/>
“But of the Quest?”<br/>
<br/>
Valens spread his arms wide, and from behind him a large servitor brought forth a crate of pure black stone and gold inlay within a stasis field.<br/>
<br/>
“Successful, Fabricator-General. Behold,” Valens gestured, and the stasis-field was released to reveal the crate which was carefully peeled open. “A fully intact STC for an advanced agricultural device, and a food processor beyond it. Our studies have shown a full 1% increase in productivity of Imperial Agri-World production as well as a 2.5% ration productivity on most Forge Worlds.”<br/>
<br/>
All tech-priests present quivered with zealous pleasure at the words spoken, their religious ecstasy causing Phokas to visibly shudder.<br/>
<br/>
“GLORY BE TO THE OMNISSIAH!”<br/>
<br/>
“GLORY BE TO THE OMNISSIAH!”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=======================<br/>​</div>“DAMN HIM!” Damion bellowed, lightning and sheer psychic force whipping in tendrils about the place as they tore apart the entire training chapel. “DAMN YOU KYRAS!”<br/>
<br/>
All of those who had returned upon the Explorator Fleet, battered and wearied and scarred from their experiences facing the monstrous inhabitants of the Ghoul Stars, had been singularly horrified at what had become of the Chapter in their absence. Some had fallen silent, and looked near to taking vows of silence. Others, like Damion, unleashed their fury upon dozens of combat servitors and training servo skulls, as well as each other. What should have been a wondrous return had become a near nightmare. Heresy, traitors, the ruination of the Librarium, that Kyras himself had instigated so much, the revelations of Vandis’ treachery…it was all almost too much.<br/>
<br/>
“Damion,” a familiar voice broke through his fury, while a steady iron will calmed the psychic torrents he had stirred up.<br/>
<br/>
He glanced up, from where he had fallen to his knees, at Justinius. Now a Chief Librarian, of all things, yet not a Chapter Master. Not now, likely not ever thanks to Kyras. The political atmosphere fostered amongst the leadership had clearly been yet one more festering pustule of corruption fostered by Kyras.<br/>
<br/>
“Justinius,” the epistolary grunted as he got to his feet. “I…apologize, I was…<i>am</i> beside myself.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is a fair thing to feel, and while the rest of us have had years to temper our rage, for you and those that have just returned it is hot and fresh.”<br/>
<br/>
Damion grunted and looked away before he felt his superior’s hand upon his pauldron.<br/>
<br/>
"Your wargear appears changed from whence I saw you last?"<br/>
<br/>
At that, some small flicker of pride burst through the gulf of shame and fury.<br/>
<br/>
"Gifts, of the Death Spectres Chapter, for our aiding them in battle against the foul things that live in the sickly light of the Ghoul Stars."<br/>
<br/>
Justinius smiled at that, before beginning to draw his brother away.<br/>
<br/>
“Come. Let us not hide away such things, and allow them to fester. We shall speak to the Chaplains, and then, we shall go forth once more. The Chapter was nearly slain, but we will not let it die, my brother.”<br/>
<br/>
A rare smiled graced the lips of the space marines, and then they left the chapel and its dozens of smoking and shattered training servitors behind.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==========================================<br/>​</div>“Sergeant,” you greet the already kneeling man. “Rise, and speak of your journey.”<br/>
<br/>
And so he does. There is much that Doukas Laskaris and his brethren faced, xenos that not even Cyrus had before due to their location within the Ghoul Stars. Against the Bone Kingdom did they fight, against more than a dozen of the most terrible and deadly xenos species with vessels of their own did they battle. It is a testament to Doukas’ own skill and leadership abilities that none of his brothers fell throughout all those decades, and only that they grew more and more skilled and refined. Doukas himself now bears a mighty gleaming sword, which he allows both you and Martellus to examine freely.<br/>
<br/>
“Explorator Valens built it for me personally after I preserved him and his most important of servants after the expedition came too close to the Bone Kingdom. The maddened necrons there brook no trespass, and despite our warnings they proceeded. It took the destruction of half the fleet and Flayed Ones phasing onto the bridge and slaughtering many before they realized their folly and retreated,” and there Doukas snorts to himself before shrugging. “In reward for our service and apparently as an acknowledgement of our own words before they ignored them, was <i>Bloodtalon</i> forged for me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Welcome home, Sergeant,” you eventually say after he has related more of his journey and that of his brothers. “Such as it is.”<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to the Chapter,” he slams a fist to his chest and bows his head, “Knowledge Is Power.”<br/>
<br/>
“None shall find us wanting," you reply, and you watch as he stumbles slightly over your response before he nods and strides away.<br/>
