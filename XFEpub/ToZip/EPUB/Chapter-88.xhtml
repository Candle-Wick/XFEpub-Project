“Note this for the Chapter’s records,” Cyrus dictated as his cybernetic eye stared unblinking through the scope.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him, the scout prepared the dataslate, while the rest of the squad that Cyrus had appropriated prepared their own weapons. The tyranids – and that was what they were, now, less and less of the Slaughra form recognizable by the day – screeched and howled as they flooded the streets. Great clouds of black smog lifted through the air from burning buildings and aflame sewers, but the Guard and Blood Ravens fought them still. A phalanx of leman russ tanks stalwartly battered their way down the block, flamer-wielding stormtroopers marching behind them to burn any and all survivors to ash. A soaring squadron of fighters and bombers burst through the clouds temporarily at such speeds as to make the skyscraper shudder, chasing and chased by slaughra counterparts, lasfire and slug-throwers chattering in violent conversation.<br/>
<br/>
“The general Slaughra leadership, as of this date, have broken down entirely, with the Patriarch of the Cult which had become the Swarm’s ruling religious and domestic figure, revealed on the capital world. In turn, the most hideously mutated yet psychically powerful servants were identified as major leaders on other worlds – thanks to the efforts of the Assassinorum. Target Delta-B76, leading slaughra mutant, major genestealer characteristics, was killed at approximately…”<br/>
<br/>
Then Cyrus fired, the sniper rifle booming in his hands. He paused a moment before turning about to face the scout, ignoring how the tyranid forms went temporarily wild as a major synapse creature was felled.<br/>
<br/>
“0178 hours,” he then finished. “As for the rest of you, continue suppression and support efforts,” he jerked his chin at the rest of the scouts.<br/>

<u><b>Decisions For 10th Company (Choose One):</b></u><br/>
[] Priority Targets: Patriarch - A Genestealer Patriarch is always the oldest purestrain of a Genestealer Cult. They are immensely powerful creatures indeed. The Slaughra Swarm's leadership was subverted long ago, and it is estimated that had the Guard not arrived, a Splinter Fleet or full Hive Fleet might have been successfully summoned in just a few short more years. As it is, the true leader of the Swarm is now revealed, or at least known, to be still holding court on the capital world, psychically ordering its servants and thus the Swarm across the entire system. The Capital World is the most heavily defended and entrenched of them all. <b>Note Primaris: The Inquisition has ordered this information purged and kept out of consumption of all notables possible, save for the highest leadership. Note Secundus: The Officio Assassinorum has dispatched an unknown agent(s) to deal with this threat, but they may not be successful.</b><br/>
[] Priority Targets: Primus Leaders: Specially bred war leaders of any extensive Genestealer Cult, the now noted Primuses of this war are effectively generals and overall theater commanders, both of tyranid bioforms and slaughra forces. They must be expunged, and quickly. Doing so will greatly reduce the power and effectiveness of the Cult forces.<br/>
[] Wider Battlefield Support: Choose a planet for the Blood Raven's 10th Company to focus its efforts on. Open combat is not the focus, nor should it be for the 10th Company, but rather sabotage, support, assassination, scouting, etc.<br/>

<div style="text-align: center">===========================<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">Once, in long ages lost, the space marines plied the stars in vast legions. They assaulted not worlds, but entire civilizations at once. Not kings, but kingdoms in their multitudes. Not warbands, but armies beyond count. For all that those days are long past, for good or ill, there remains yet the ancient imperative and skill honed to the finest edge in the galaxy. Planetary assault, not the battles of the void, is what the space marines, the Adeptus Astartes were built for. No longer do they march in their hundreds and thousands, a great and terrible hammer and anvil in one unified form. But still the Codex provides, at least somewhat, for what must be done when it must be done. Above the world whose name would be unpronouncable to human throats - not that they would ever care to - which had been obscured for so long beneath a vast storm, crimson and black wove together into the shape of doom. The striker cruisers were one thing, yes, but they were not battle barges. Shells were loaded, cannons were primed, and the fleets of three entire companies slowly drifted into position. All the while, great tears in the storm lattice exposed the dark world below to the sunlight once more before rapidly healing once more. One tear remained widest and unhealing, a weeping sore on what had previously been an elegant if horrific defense in construction and continuation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Orbital Bombardment 1: 69<br/>

<br/>
The heavens cracked and split, and split, and split, and split yet again. Bombardment shells flew sideways upon entering atmosphere , great blasts of light and devastation never reached the ground, and the silver and crystalline towers which just barely met the void itself seemed to shift in place. All the while, the great armies upon the world below began to scream and shift, driven to the highest of frenzies. Orders are bawled out, but the ground is prepared. Mines, turrets, rapiers, weapons aplenty. You are not the Imperial Fists, or any of their successors, but you will never let it be said that the Blood Ravens cannot hold their positions. What trenches could be rapidly dug have been, and there are no more preparations to make. They are coming, and surround you on all sides, for they know that their empowerment, the shifting of reality that allows much of them and their weapons to even function and exist at <i>all</i> may soon be ended if they do not stop you, do not repair the towers.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Opening Statements: 95</b><br/>
<br/>
And then Hadrian fires a krak launcher towards the distant enemy, managing astonishingly to strike one of the spawn in its open ululating throat, destroying the head entirely. The rest of the 4th Company stares at their Captain as he roars epithets at the enemy, before at once the deluge begins. Open sunlight abruptly falls upon charging hundreds, then thousands of pairs of mutated appendages which drag, push, and pull their attendant bodies forward into the battle. The turrets and rapiers open up, then the tanks, and then the whirlwinds.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Orbital Bombardment 1: 9<br/>
Orbital Bombardment 2: 88<br/>
Orbital Bombardment 3: 75</b><br/>
<br/>
Later, it would be learned that a minute error in processing shut the <i>Litany of Furies</i> weapons down, leaving the greatest of the 5th Fleet to have to forcefully sooth its machine spirit and recalculate yet again. While the greatest of the battle barges of the Blood Ravens unleashed true hell with the weapons of humanity upon the tower below it, the <i>Scientia </i>did the same. For too long had that venerable vessel lain in half-life after the Purge of the traitors and heretics within the Chapter, and it exercised that fury below as it returned to its one true purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Holding Ground<br/>
67 vs. 36</b><br/>
<br/>
The trenches had been abandoned, but only for a moment, before the explosives within went off. Great piles of shells surrounded the feet of the terminator squads and dreadnoughts, assault cannons spewing spent casings upon the ground. You stood at the forefront, <i>Godsplitter</i> held lightly in one hand while the other fired with a bolter. With your terminator armor and own bionic enhancements, it was as easy as it had ever been. Easier, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Orbital Bombardment 1: 86<br/>
Orbital Bombardment 2: 65<br/>

<br/>
The earth trembled again, and again, yet this time from the heavens, and not from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Holding Ground<br/>
43 vs. 41</b><br/>
<br/>
The foe knew what was happening, perhaps felt the cracks torn into the towers themselves, and threw themselves forward with even greater abandon. Yet you could not push them back, and instead were forced to give ground. Grudgingly, to be sure, but the deadlock was apparent to anyone with the slightest amount of tactical sense.<br/>
<br/>

Final Assault: <br/>
41 vs. 33</b><br/>
<br/>
One of the greater spawn disappeared mid-charge, to terrified screams and howls. The change was immediate. Many of the larger creatures whose biology had only been possible with the powers of the warp infusing them...disappeared. Or died screaming as they were suddenly unsupported by their own malformed bodies. Then some of their weapons stopped working, belches of warpstuff no longer blasting into the barely holding psychic shields of the librarians. As one creature, still determined to fight and die for their damned God, leapt for you and was smote down by <i>Godsplitter</i>, the skies opened further. The storm itself began to tear and rip free from its moors, as its long and tortured existence flickered.<br/>
<br/>
And then it tore open completely, down the middle, two towers crumbling to dust in the distance where you could not see or hear.<br/>
<br/>
It was enough, the Librarians would later note in their studies, to break the entire lattice. It was a self-supporting structure, self-propagating. It rejuvenated, for lack of a better word, those slaughra and mutants who had lived in the shadow of it for so long. But it was reliant on them, their sacrifices and works to keep the towers functioning and stable. When enough of the towers were knocked out, burnt away, the entire structure failed, for what remained was increasingly over stressed by what had occurred and was unable to keep up the now vastly increased upkeep. Thus, when another tower was burnt out by the demands placed upon it, so followed another, then another, and another. A cascade of failures, each with spectacular explosions and collapses unique to each tower. The worldstorm tore itself apart, as the sorcery which had crafted it died out. You, of course, saw none of this.<br/>
<br/>
What <i>you</i> saw was a world's xenos populace dying. They died fighting, which on some level might be admired, but they died all the same. Their greatest were slain as the laws of reality asserted themselves once more. Their lessers were overtaken by a storm not of lightning, but of bolter shells and lasfire. Of lascannons and krak missiles. Some ran away, tried to flee, once they realized the truth of things. Perhaps to try and hide, perhaps they were simply so afraid of these giants who had come to their world and brought such total ruination that they fled without thinking at all. It didn't matter. The landspeeders ran them down, while thunderhawks corralled others. To be certain, there remained yet entire armies worth of slaughra and mutants upon the world, but while some could still manifest their powers, their greatest sites had been broken before them.<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: center"><b>Set Plans For For Stage Seven Of Engagement:</b>​</div><div style="text-align: left">[] Extermination: Unto the last. Every single piece of Slaughra architecture must be purged, stone by stone. It is all tainted, and what can be cleansed by fire must be. In this, you and the Sisters of Battle might agree. They have no support, they had no factories or major industrial sites, for all they had was of bone and blood and accursed sorcery. Hunt them all down, and finish cleansing this world utterly. Hunt them from the skies and along the ground until there is no trace of them left. [Blood Ravens Utterly Cleanse Swarmworld Theta, Ensuring Much Easier Imperial Claiming Efforts Later On]<br/>
<b>OR</b><br/>
[] Attacking The Heart: These are but dregs, now, barely worth fighting let alone spending an extensive amount of time killing. Besides which...the Imperium is making its move. While the Sisters of Battle are not wholly finished on their own chosen target worlds, the Navy is moving out against the most dangerous of all the targets, the Daemonworld. It is known that a great amount of Lost Rosetta sisters are travelling there as well on-board multiple ships to repulse boarders or teleported daemons or otherwise. The Blood Ravens should join in this great endeavor. Admiral Graves is leading this attack, for he is the highest ranking Navy officer present. But you must decide how you approach this attack.<br/>
-[] Accept Orders: You position is yet tenuous. Admiral Graves would order your ships within his greater battle plan, if you allow him. This might ease tensions...or provide a way for him to order the ships of the Blood Ravens into danger.<br/>
<b>OR</b><br/>
-[] Act Independently: Remain aloof. Aid where you wish, attack where you wish, and let Graves keep up and adapt to your own interventions as he must. The Blood Ravens cannot risk the unknown wishes of Graves when you know of the treachery already faced by Cyrus in his own fighting.<br/>
