    <h2>Turn 2 - 2470.5</h2>
Winning plan:

[X] [Report] Stick with the facts, but highlight that Wilhelmina's work in getting back the former workers and funneling them to you was a big help in your task.
[X] The disappearance of your predecessor is very concerning, he must be found.
[X] There is a risk of enemy agents infiltrating the castle staff - they must be watched.
[X] There was an incident with a... something. You killed it, but there may be more. The castle should be searched from top to bottom.
[X] A dozen centuries of tax ledgers and records don't just vanish. They need to be found.

Most of your report is laying down what you know of the former Spymaster, Wilhelm von Tarshof, and his activities. You start with his personal control over the cities of the Old Dwarf Road and his neglect of the rest of Stirland, before moving on to the Stirlandian League cartel and their monopoly on north-south trade. At this point Van Hal looks displeased; when you mention the murder of the Baron of Purgg and his family, he looks outraged. Then you throw in (with due credit to Wilhelmina) that someone attempted to infiltrate the castle and feed you misinformation about von Tarshof. Finally, you top it off with the discovery of... whatever it was barricaded in the servant's quarters, as well as your own vanquishing of the creature.

Your report garners quite a few reactions elsewhere from the table - Anton seems flabbergasted at the duplicity von Tarshof, Wilhelmina is outraged at the Stirlandian League and their apparent tariff immunity, and Herr Schultz looks almost sick at the idea of possible enemies behind his partially-refurbished stone walls.

Van Hal's fingers drum on the table, his brows furrowed, as he considers the options you've put towards him. Finally, he nods to himself and speaks. "Herr Schultz! Are your workers able to go about things without your constant oversight?"

"To a certain degree, my lord," he replies uncertainly.

"Take a few Greatswords with you and map the castle. Dimensions and all. Find any more dead space, and Brother Kasmir and I will investigate." You see excitement cross his face at the prospect, the anticipatory grin making him look almost boyish. "Wilhelmina, will you be able to do without those archives?"

She thinks about it, and then shakes her head reluctantly. "It'd be a stop-gap at best, and it would fail eventually. Even apart from not knowing what the lords are supposed to be paying in taxes, those documents spell out the details of the feudal contract between you and Stirland. If word gets out we don't have them, it would be a massive loss of legitimacy."

"Then that will be our priority. Journeywoman Weber, find those documents by whatever means necessary. I'll put a platoon of Greatswords at your disposal. Get me those books."

With that taken care of, the rest of the meeting goes quickly - Professor de Verezzo is sent out to start gathering troops to refill the ranks of the military, Anton is sent out to capitalize on the goodwill his party garnered and hopefully keep the taxes flowing in, and Brother Kasmir will be setting up a chapel to Sigmar in the castle.

Once again, you're in the guest room planning the next six months. Though keeping a fire lit regularly has banished the worst of the smell and the castle's servants replaced the sheets, it's still a dingy, cramped little room with no view, no space, and little security. When you pictured your service to the Empire, it didn't feature this sort of thing.

You have six actions to spend.

[ ] As Per Orders: Perform your current assignment.
-[ ] Money Solves Problems: You've got a discretionary fund, Wurtbad has town criers. Put out word of a reward and see if anyone knows anything about a cartload or five of books wandering off.
-[ ] Record-Keeping: The Wurtbad Watch keeps a record of every cart that goes through the gates. See if there's any useful information to be found in their record books.
-[ ] Straight to the Source: Or you could ask the Watchmen directly. Human memory is more fallible than written records, but it would be a lot faster and there might be something that wasn't written down.
-[ ] Door Kickers: Wilhelm von Tarshof is one candidate for the theft, and though he's nowhere to be found, the Stirlandian League is a public organization. Start kicking down some doors.
-[ ] Or You Could Ask Nicely: Or, I guess, you could knock politely on those doors and ask them about it.
-[ ] Wilhelmina says that most of the nobles are unknowingly helping with rebuilding the tax code. Maybe those that aren't are hiding something.
-[ ] While the Greatswords are at your disposal, have one of them train you in the art of Greatswording.

[ ] Divided Loyalty: you've been told to prepare a report on Anton.
-[ ] Write down what little you know about him already and send it off. Does not take an action.
-[ ] Investigate Anton and prepare a full report on him. Does take an action.
-[ ] Send no report. What's the worst that can happen? (if your Master was being honest about you being declared rogue for this, this is very likely to result in a Game Over)

[ ] Backtracking and Side Operations:
-[ ] You haven't asked Anton about your predecessor - see if he knows anything useful.
-[ ] The thing you stabbed in the face is still in the cells, thoroughly distressing the stablehand one cell over. Examine it, learn from it, see if you can identify it.
-[ ] Speaking of the stablehand, maybe he'll be willing to tell you why he was feeding you misinformation. If not, maybe you could convince him.
-[ ] Put some time aside to interview everyone that works in the castle. If nothing else, it might make anyone that's up to anything nervous.
-[ ] If Van Hal and Brother Kasmir are killing monsters, you want in. Make yourself available to help out if Schultz finds anything.

[ ] Laying Groundwork: You can't keep an ear out for gossip if nobody's talking to you. Go out and rekindle old connections with:
-[ ] Wurtbad: The townspeople of Wurtbad.
-[ ] Surrounds: The peasantry in the villages surrounding Wurtbad; Julbach, Biderhof and Tarshof.

[ ] Getting To Know You: Spend time with one of your fellow councillors, offering your help in their task and generally getting a feel for them (choose one).
[ ] Getting To Know You Whether You Like It Or Not: You've been given good reason to mistrust your fellow councillors. Perhaps you should see what they spent their time doing (choose one).
[ ] Sucking Up To The Boss: Normally you'd just go about things and report in to the Elector Count when you've got something major to report. If you instead give him regular reports and updates, it may make him more willing to trust you, and allow you to better get to know him. Opening yourself up to oversight, criticism, and potential micromanagement is a heavy price to pay, though.
[ ] Letters Home: You might be able to wring more information out of your Master, or you might just be able to get news, information and guidance in general from the Grey Order.
[ ] A Matter of Faith: Your personal shrine to Ranald is back in Altdorf. Construct a new one, so that he can better watch over you here.
[ ] Hang Out A Shingle: Spymasters don't advertise, but wizards sometimes do. Make an official announcement that there's a wizard in residence, and see who comes out of the woodwork.
[ ] Now that you've got gold to throw around, you should stock up on spell components. They're not strictly necessary, but they do make things easier. (-personal gold)

[ ] Self-Improvement: Things have been going well so far, but the skills of a Journeyman Grey Mage can only go so far.
-[ ] Practice, Practice, Practice: Having been thrown into the deep end of imperial politics, it would probably be a good idea to brush up on your skills (choose one).
-[ ] Tutoring: One of your fellow councillors may be willing to teach you in their chosen field (choose who).
-[ ] Combat Training: You're virtually surrounded by armed warriors of various sorts. See if you can convince one to teach you (choose who).
-[ ] Combat Training, In The Free Market: You haven't made many heavily armed friends yet, but gold is good for that. Go out and buy some training. (-personal gold)
-[ ] You only really kept in practice with a handful of the petty and minor magics you were taught. Maybe you should brush up on the others.
-[ ] You're naturally talented at enchantment; so far, this just amounts to being able to make your desk meow for about an hour. See if you can improve on that, or at least figure out a way to make that useful.

[ ] Home Comforts: Surely there's a more suitable place for you to set up shop than a mouldering guest room. See about securing lodgings:
-[ ] Elsewhere in the castle, somewhere you can set up a permanent base of operations.
-[ ] In one of the guard towers along the walls of Wurtbad. You can't be much of a wizard without a tower.
-[ ] In a local tavern, so you can keep your fingers on the pulse of the town.
-[ ] In a piece of local real estate, so you can craft it to your specifications. The downside is it will be completely known and accessible to everyone.
-[ ] In a hidden place within Wurtbad, either under the ground or within the slums.
-[ ] In a town near Wurtbad - it will mean commuting to work, but you could work on building up a power base out of the way.
-[ ] In the wilderness near Wurtbad - it will be uncomfortable and probably dangerous, but at least it will be very, very secret.

[ ]Research:
-[ ] This is Stirland. Time to bone up on your knowledge of the Undead.
-[ ] That damn Asp has been quiet, but maybe it's just biding it's time. Finally admit it's existence to your contacts back in the College and see if they know anything that can help.
-[ ] As a Journeywoman, the path to Magister is marked by mastering more than the two shadow spells you already know. Send to the Grey Order for the basics and work on figuring out one of the others.
-[ ] As a Journeywoman, the path to mediocrity is marked by only learning spells created by others. Your relationship with Ulgu is between you and it. (create-a-spell, write in the effects)


FINANCES: NO ACTION POINT EXPENDITURE.

Do you pay the required tithe to the Grey Order? Not paying would be a bad idea.
[ ] Yes (-5 personal gold/turn)
[ ] No

Do you start paying your student loans?
[ ] Yes - enough to get it paid off in the foreseeable future (-35 personal gold/turn)
[ ] Yes - enough to keep them off my back (-15 personal gold/turn)

Do you skim your discretionary budget?
[ ] I see no contradiction in being an honest spymaster. (no change)
[ ] Perk of the job, you know. It's practically expected. (+50 personal gold, -50 discretionary gold, absolutely no risk)
[ ] Money don't grow on trees, and I got bills to pay. (+100 personal gold, -100 discretionary gold, almost no risk)
[ ] What's good for me is good for Stirland. (+150 personal gold, -150 discretionary gold, some risk)
[ ] 'Discretionary' is just another word for 'mine'. (+200 personal gold, -200 discretionary gold, moderate risk)


- Assume that every non-binary category has an 'other - write in' option. Voting will be in plan format, including finances.
- Keep in mind that spending every waking moment on the job is certainly laudable and will help win over Van Hal, but it does mean that you're not climbing the power curve.
- Typical working week for your fellow councillors would be spending two to four 'actions' on their job and the rest on their personal life and other responsibilities, depending on their level of dedication.
- Options to spend gold on things like magical workshops / laboratories / personal libraries / et cetera will become unlocked once you're not living in a guest room.
- A platoon, in this case, is 25 men.
- A reminder that you get paid 50 gold/turn for being spymaster.
