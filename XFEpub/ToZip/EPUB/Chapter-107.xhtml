Once more you dive into the peacefully academic world of the Grey College. When you were a mere Apprentice, it wasn't unusual for a Magister to show up towards the end of classes and lectures and lurk in the back row, and you remember assuming that they were there to keep an eye on a specific student or possibly the teacher. Now it is you who is lurking in the back row, and you make no effort to dispel the assumptions of the Apprentices who have become your classmates. And not out of entertainment, though it certainly supplies plenty of that, but to get them used to the idea that they are being watched. The Grey College keeps a keen eye on the activities of all those that fall under its banner, and for good reason. And once the Apprentices file out, you approach the instructor and make your desires known, and after hours of teaching the very basics of Ulgu most leap at the chance to dive into the trickier aspects.

Some begin their lessons on the spot, others invite you to office hours or study groups with older Journeymen and younger Magisters, and the very least amount of help you got was an extremely swamped lecturer who still took a minute to point you towards some of the better tomes on the subjects before they hurried off. The neutral rooms of the College cannot compare to the one in your tower back home, though admittedly they are designed more around containing a sudden and violent discharge of magic than they are about achieving complete and constant magical neutrality, but you put a few to good use anyway. It's not a good idea to grow complacent, especially when dealing with spells you've never even attempted before.

[Magical multitasking: Learning, 41+26=67. Three spells.]
[A Consideration of Suitability: 38+30(College Rep)=68.]
[Rolling...]
[Learning Illusion: 7+26=33.]

Though you have more than enough magical power to cast them, you've yet to learn much of the penultimate tier of Grey Magic. As a spell, Illusion bears the most similarity to Eye of the Beholder and Mutable Visage, both of which you know but neither of which you've used too often. Most of the spells you regularly use require a single and straightforward mental state to cast, and only a minor effort of will to maintain. Illusion requires that you not only hold a specific mental state, but you simultaneously picture the illusion you wish to create. And not just how it looks, but how it sounds and smells, too. You constantly fail to maintain a balance between the mental state to manipulate Ulgu and the mental image of the intended effect, always ending up focusing on one to the detriment of the other and having the spell collapse in on itself. More time to practice would probably get you there, but between the other spells you're trying to learn and your upcoming deadlines elsewhere, you just can't justify it.

[Rolling...]
[Learning Universal Confusion: 21+26=47.]

Universal Confusion likewise evades you, and for a similar reason. You are very much able to perform all sorts of spells on a single target, but every time you try to scale up you find yourself enforcing the effects serially, instead of simultaneously. You're told several times that making good process on learning two separate extremely difficult spells is amazing progress for a time investment of weeks, but you're unable to take it to heart.

[Rolling...]
[Learning Throttling: 37+26=63.]

Thankfully, your third spell sees much greater progress, possibly because it was your once-Master, now-equal Magister Regimand that laid the foundations before hurrying off again to deal with some crisis or another, having come out of 'retirement' once more. Though you've yet to invest the time in bringing your shadow fully under your control, it turns out to be an enthusiastic participant in Throttling, as a number of paid volunteers (with another Magister standing by to dispel, just in case) can attest. The moment the spell reaches its intended target, they're helpless, and unless someone is available to intervene they're totally at your mercy. You're once more reminded exactly why the Grey College goes to such length to vet and observe its graduates - in the wrong hands, the spell could be put to any number of evil ends.

Your collegiate interlude must come to an end, and this time your target is Blutdorf, where once more the major figures of the EIC gather to hear your words. You could simply give orders along these lines, but you're very much aware of how little an order can mean when the one who gave it isn't watching. As the Kislevites say: the Gods are high above, and the Tzar is far away. And while the EIC as a whole has bought into Wilhelmina's personal policy of 'don't skin the sheep', you're very aware that even the best-kept sheep are pinned down and forcibly shorn on a regular basis, so you don't want to entrust the Empire's long-term good to that alone.

So instead of commanding, you need to make them believe your words, and a week back in Eight Peaks prepared you for the task. Under the sceptical eye of burghers, carters and stevedores, you make a multi-pronged attack on selfish profit. You describe the perpetual state of every variety of anarchy in the Border Princes, and the many threats nearby that can and likely eventually will wipe out every one of them. You tell of the constant sacrifice in lives and materiel that keeps the roads safe and the rivers clear, and you tell them of how much it costs to hire a proper protective detail from Barak Varr to go through roads that have no such protections, and how little of even the best equipped return. And knowing your largely Stirlandian audience, you speak at length about Sylvania. The years between Boris Goldgatherer's death and the coronation of Mandred Ratslayer, when the plague raged through the territory again and again and only a stalemate between two existential threats kept the Sylvanians from total extinction.

Then you move on to the Time of the Three Emperors, when central power disintegrated and each individual city became vulnerable to any and every threat that wandered along. The Battle of Meadow Glades, and the town that was exterminated by the Elves of Athel Loren in retaliation for the trespass. The Night of the Restless Dead, when Sylvania declared independence. The Waaagh of Gorbad Ironclaw, which utterly destroyed Solland and came damn close to destroying Averland and the Moot. The Von Carsteins and the three Vampire Wars. The Fourth Sack of Marienburg. The corruption of the Order of the Blood Dragon. The partial destruction of Mordheim by meteor, and the subsequent complete destruction of Mordheim by anarchy. And finally, the Great War Against Chaos, and how close the Empire came to extinction before Magnus the Pious took power, defeated the Everchosen Asavar Kul, and rebuilt the Empire into the one that allowed each of them the chance to profit so handsomely from trade between provinces and countries.

You wrap up the presentation by reiterating the central point: the Empire was not merely needed for any profit to be made, it was needed to prevent the violent death of every single person present. Judging by the near-universal looks of horror on the faces of everyone present, you feel you managed to get the message across.

It wasn't by coincidence you chose to retell the tale of the 'Ratslayer'.

It would be utter madness to take the Liber Mortis with you for light reading along the way, so instead you read through several chapters at speed and digested the information in your spare time while journeying. You had expected the infamous tome to be a spellbook, or at most a textbook on the topic of Necromancy. That it is almost entirely filled with the innermost thoughts of a genius as he grappled with the secrets of magic and pursued a war against an implacable foe and was instead known entirely for the spells in its appendix gives you one more reason, if any were needed, to be sure that modern Necromancers are utter, utter fools.

Over nearly a decade, the undead and the Skaven fought to a standstill in a type of war unlike any you've ever known, where lives are expended like munitions and arbitrary amounts of reinforcements are a given. Dozens of tricks, traps and feints are laid out in exhaustive detail, as are the means Frederick used to counter them. You're able to use these chapters and your ruminations on them to identify and examine a great deal of your own assumptions about warfare because of how thoroughly Frederick's war shatters each of them. And throughout it all, detailed every month like clockwork, you see a genius track his own progress towards incurable madness, as the cumulative exposure to Dhar begins to show. And to your surprise, the notes are supplemented by the incredibly neat and precise handwriting of what must be Vlad who is not yet von Carstein, as he gives an external and impartial perspective on the progression of the corruption.

Not exactly comforting bedtime reading, and you desperately hope you never need any of the information. But now you have it.

You spend the rest of your time in Blutdorf going over the books and making notes of improvements to be made - not for profitability, but for compatibility with the Empire at large. Tweaks were made to the tax farmers, as everyone is brought in line with what the regular tax collectors would have taken, and those closest to power get refunds while those furthest from it are pursued despite the difficulty. When the Stirlandian tax collectors resume their work, there should be no change except in who the money goes to. The factory under construction has some policies set in stone right from the start, as the supply contract with Stirland is reinforced with very stern warnings that the Army of Stirland has first refusal on every single gun and not one can go anywhere other than east to the armies unless the Army of Stirland has explicitly stated that they do not wish to purchase it, even on credit, and every other purchaser must satisfy themselves with the products of Blutdorf's crossbow factory instead.

As the year approaches its end, you have a final appointment to keep and a task to perform. With Eight Peaks mostly secure and Kragg apparently sticking around for a while, he's gifted his modified gyrobomber to the Hold and further modifications have been made to extend its range even further and make travelling in it more bearable, but only so much can be done. The Hammerer escort takes a while to stretch, grumble, and fortify themselves for the final leg of the journey at a nearby tavern, and you wait patiently and understandingly as they rediscover the wonders of being able to move around.

It was a mostly normal day in Wurtbad. Sure, the Elector Countess was present for a change, doing the bare minimum to keep Western and Central Stirland functioning before throwing herself back into the Sylvanian campaign, but that didn't make much difference. She only received the most important of callers and had no taste for balls or festivals, so what did the average citizen of Wurtbad care?

Then the high, buzzing hum started to be heard, and those in the street started to exchange nervous glances and look about for its source as it grew in volume. Finally, one sharper-eyed than the others pointed at a trio of dots on the horizon, growing in size as they approached the city. Concern lessened and curiosity doubled as one of the few that had encountered the Dwarven flying machines before identified them and the information rippled through the city, and when the massive gyrocarriage and its escorts finally flew over the city walls most of the population had spilled onto the streets to join in the gawking.

With Festag being yesterday and Marktag two days into the future, the marketplace in front of the Temple of Sigmar was only lightly crowded and free of stalls, and as the flying machines slowed to a hover overhead the crowd cleared at the shouted insistence of the local Priest of Sigmar, and the largest began to descend as the other two circled watchfully overhead. The moment it touched down, the metal compartments that ran down both sides of the machine swung open, and from each side five Dwarves dismounted, polished mail glinting, eyes narrowed in suspicion, and hands tight on their shimmering hammers. When the staring crowd showed no sign of imminent attack, one knocked twice on the metal of the aircraft, and from what was once a bombardier's station the final passenger emerged - one that all present knew by reputation, and some by sight. The Dämmerlichtreiter.

With the last of its cargo unloaded, the gyrocarriage once more rose into the air, and as the Wizard and her escort strode through the streets with the full expectation that a path would clear for them - and clear it certainly did - the flying machines remained hovering nearby, ready to swoop in and evacuate the Karak's delegate at a moment's notice.

Word sprints ahead of you at the speed of gossip as the stately march appropriate for your station proceeds past the Watch Station you once commanded, past the building that Julia Massif still operates out of, past the headquarters of the EIC, and up the road to the castle you've walked along so many times before. You've left Abelhelm's former hat in the gyrocarriage so you're missing the extra height it would normally give you, but a squad of Royal Guards with runic hammers older than the Empire beats any amount of hats. Instead of being foolish enough to block your way, the Greatswords at the gates stand to attention as you pass, and you pass through the achingly familiar courtyard and into the audience hall of Eagle Castle.

"Nudalit nudaled annudalit, Ekumgrik Roswita. Dawrik, ordohdrengi a Dawrik Belegar Angrund a Vala-Azril-Ungol. Or-Mhornzhufokrul Mathilde Weber, Orgnoli a Vala-Azril-Ungol."

You vaguely recognize a few faces in the small crowd that has parted for you to approach the throne - locals of importance, various representatives of counts and barons, castle staff. In front of you, one of the few faces you recognize is the one on the throne, though you saw it only once before - Roswita Van Hal, Elector Countess of Stirland and daughter of Abelhelm. She seems to have aged faster than the few years it's been would allow, and has put on muscle and is wearing the leathers you previously saw her in much more naturally. The Witch Hunter by her side is the same one that accompanied her when she arrived, though he's lost an arm and gained a few scars. Whispering in her ear is a Priest of Sigmar, who by his heavyset frame and lack of armour isn't as militant as Brother Kasmir was, but he would know and be able to translate the ritual greeting you've just given. Rounding out her currently-present advisors are Detlef Schultz and Gustav von Jungfreud, neither of which seems to have changed much, and they give you nods of greeting as your eyes move to them. And behind them all, a squad of Greatswords to match yours of Hammerers.

The castle steward - not the Steward of Stirland, but the man who manages the crowd during audiences like this, and a constant source of titular confusion - takes the documents you hold out to him, carefully examines the incredibly intricate seal of Karak Eight Peaks, then passes them to Roswita with a nod and she breaks it open to scan them, and probably also to buy herself time to think. Magister Mathilde would probably start to rankle under the silence, and Dame Weber certainly would, but Dawongr Weber is appropriately patient and appreciates thoroughness, especially when she can use the time too. You fix your eyes on the throne, and then ignore them, as your keener senses come to the fore.

The Witch Hunter is a coiled spring, and has the strange taste of divinity about him that you're learning to associate with those who can wield the miracles of their God. The Priest is not so blessed, and from the dimness of his thoughts you doubt he has the wisdom to make up for Sigmar's apparent lack of trust in him. But Roswita... Roswita is interesting. Traces of Hysh buzz through her, signifying a genuine belief in the purity of her cause, and glowing embers of Aqshy signify strong emotion, possibly a temper, possibly courage. Lingering Chamon in her sword-arm, which signifies a lot of time spent either sparring or fighting. But most of all, boiling within her brain like a thunderstorm about to break, is a level of Shyish that wouldn't be out of place in an Amethyst Apprentice.

Roswita Van Hal genuinely believes she is soon to die. And from the well-worn grooves in her soul, she has believed it for quite a while.

"Stirland's greetings to our allies of the Karaz Ankor," she says, and you let your mundane sight regain your focus once more. "The success of the Expedition to Karak Eight Peaks has brought joy to Sigmar's Empire. How can we serve the Dwarves?"

"As you may know, many sons of Stirland answered King Belegar Ironhammer's call to arms, and performed great service against the greenskins that once infested Karak Eight Peaks. They were repaid handsomely in silver, but the debt is not fully repaid. King Belegar wishes to present a sword of gromril to each group that answered his summons, and the one who led the Stirlanders has proven too modest to claim it. So we ask that as Ruler of the People of Stirland, you or one you delegate be present to accept the weapon on behalf of the Stirlanders that fought for the King."

Many eyes in the room go to the sword at Roswita's hip, the Runefang Orc Hewer. Gromril swords from Dwarven Kings carries a great deal of meaning in the Empire.

You can tell she wants to say no. Her focus is on the east, not the south. But if a Dwarven King extends a hand of friendship, there is no possible answer for those that follow Sigmar except to take it.

[Rolling...]

Her eyes flick from you to the Hammerers behind you and back again, and she steels herself. "The Elector Countess of Stirland accepts this honour, and I will leave for Karak Eight Peaks before sunset."

The route back to Karak Eight Peaks is long and difficult for one not escorted by a Dawongr. What route will you recommend?

[ ] Ride to Zhufbar, and take enough gyrocopters to transport you, your escort, the Elector Countess, and her escort. Fast, minimizes conversation and comfort.
[ ] Ride to Black Fire Pass and take a Dwarven monitor down Skull River, stop at Barak Varr, and then up Blood River. Reasonably fast, comfortable, maximizes Dwarf-y showing off.
[ ] Ride all the way to Karak Eight Peaks. Slow, but maximizes showing off with Shadowsteed.


Anton will be arriving in Eight Peaks for the celebration after you do. How will you spend your time with him? The two with the most votes will be chosen. You will also introduce him to Wolf.

[ ] Introduce him to all the single Journeymanlings.
[ ] Introduce him to the self-proclaimed Questing Knight Soizic.
[ ] Introduce him to the We and see if he makes friends with them.
[ ] Introduce him to King Belegar as a source of crossbows for the Undumgi.
[ ] Introduce him to King Belegar as a seasoned diplomat who can round up mercenaries for him.
[ ] Introduce him to Prince Gotri as a factory builder seeking his advice in gunsmithing.


Wilhelmina will also be arriving soon. She's rather intense lately, and is likely to want to spend time on business rather than making friends. How will you spend your time with her? Only one will win.

[ ] Introduce her to the We and the silk they produce, so she can begin preparing for the economic upheaval about to hit the unsuspecting Empire.
[ ] Introduce her to King Kazador, the ruler of a Karak that hasn't been able to spend a single penny on luxuries for thousands of years.
[ ] Introduce her to King Belegar, who has a hoard to spend and is desperate enough for firepower to buy from manlings.
[ ] Introduce her to King Byrrnoth of Barak Varr, who would love to have a new distributor in the Empire for all the valuables from the East now that Death Pass is secure.


Then there's the matter of the EIC. You've instilled values that guarantee their reputation with the Empire will be symbiotic, rather than parasitic or predatory. Is that all she feels is necessary?

[ ] Mathilde's intervention with the EIC was to prevent them from being a new Stirlandian League. That mission is accomplished. Pull back and let it manage itself.
Mathilde will stop being actively involved with the EIC, and will regain the one action per turn that is currently invested in it.

[ ] The EIC is a tool that can allow Mathilde to economically intervene in all sorts of ways. She will wield it as such for the good of the Empire and its allies.
The EIC mechanics will remain as they currently are, and Mathilde will be able to extend generous trade agreements to her allies through it.

[ ] The EIC has potential to be an amazing source of information, and now that it can be trusted, Mathilde will shape it as such.
Mathilde will build an information network within the EIC, keeping an eye on both it and on everywhere it reaches. This becomes an ordinary organization, and can be managed alongside one other organization or underling for one action per turn.

[ ] Mathilde wants to help the EIC grow and profit for the sake of riches. Vow of Poverty be damned.
The EIC mechanics will remain as they currently are, and Mathilde will continue to help the EIC gain economic footholds wherever she has influence.
