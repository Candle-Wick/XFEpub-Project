While the Colleges would insist that there's no actual enmity between the Colleges and it goes no further than friendly rivalry, relations between the Light and Grey Colleges can come close at times, and despite what an outsider might think, the cause isn't the difference in their magics but the similarity of their priorities. Both concern themselves with fighting corruption within the Colleges and the Empire, but where the Grey Order does so through soft power, realpolitik, and the occasional messy example, the Light Order does so through an often unreasonable fanaticism and pursuit of purity, both literal and metaphorical. Still, all the Colleges are on the same side, and your good name is no less bankable with them than any other College.

That doesn't mean you're going to do something silly like actually subject yourself to their ridiculous entrance ritual, so after you sent a firkin of fine Dwarven ale to Lord Magister Olenus in appreciation for his work on the MAP, you wait for your contact within a rather charming cafe near the nexus of power that the Light College is built upon. This part of Altdorf is noticeably cleaner than all but the wealthiest districts, mostly due to the College - they don't, of course, actually do cleaning themselves, but the protections of the Light College wreak particular havoc on the sense of direction of those without magic, and the Light Order spread a rumour that anyone particularly lost can improve their chances of finding their destination if they take a moment or two to see to the cleanliness of wherever they find themselves. Perhaps it's a sign of surprising cunning from the straight-laced Light Order, but you wouldn't put it past them to have actually worked that into their concealment.

Choirmaster Stephen is an affable and dotty sort it's hard not to like, but there's a mind like steel underneath that. Unlike most of the Colleges, the Light Order maintains ties with all of the more respectable Cults within the Empire, in no small part to allow them to scour every orphanage they can for the slightest hint of magical talent. This does leave them with significantly more Perpetual Apprentices than most, which suits them just fine because Hysh is apparently quite straightforward to use in concert with others. An individual Apprentice might not have much power, but twenty working in unison can pack a hell of a punch, making 'Choirmaster' a much more formidable title than it may otherwise appear. So you rise to greet him, thank him for his time, and try to ignore the poor candle on the table in front of you as it tries to dim and brighten at the same time.

"We tend to be a bit wary about giving out the gifts of Hysh," he says, carefully unfolding a cloth wrapping. "However, it seems unlikely that even the Grey College could weaponize the banishment of illness, except against those that all weapons should be levelled against." The final fold of cloth is pulled back, and a glimmer of light attracts every eye in the cafe, which then hastily turn back to their business when they note that it's wizards doing wizard things.

You look thoughtfully down at what appears to be an unadorned cylinder of quartz or glass containing what looks like a pure-white liquid, but your Magesight can tell it's 'only' densely-packed Hysh. "Is this battlefield-portable?"

He taps it with a knuckle, producing a ringing note. "To an extent. I wouldn't put it in the bottom of your bag, but some of our more active sorts keep something like this in a padded pouch without trouble." He picks it up and peers at one end of it, then turns it over. "The active end has the Rune of Hysh on it. Tap it - any person, or any living creature for that matter, can activate it - and it will begin to emit light from the top, not unlike a candle. Hold it in both hands close to your body and it will go to work. It takes about five minutes, no matter the severity of the malady."

You take the 'candle' from him and prod the rune warily, and Hysh leaks from it and forms a small but radiant sphere of energy floating above it. "Capacity and recharge?"

"Variable, it shines as bright as is needed. You could cure a score of food poisoning, but only two of Neighlish Rot. Sunlight is best for recharging, two hours or so will do the trick, though lenses or some other way of concentrating it can speed that up considerably. Fire can do the trick as long as you keep it outside of radiant Aqshy range. Alternately, holding it while in a deep meditative state or truly devout prayer can recharge it, but it does tend to be tricky to reach either state when you're focused on the candle."

You thank him, and he smiles, claps you on the shoulder, and turns ninety degrees vertically and vanishes from sight.

Your original plan for the weaponized portion of the Grey Tower consisted of a 360-degree view, a revolving chair for you to sit in, and nothing else. Now that it can operate without a Grey Wizard providing the fine control, you've had to expand that somewhat, and a control console has been built on a moving track around the perimeter of the room, featuring three levers, three switches, and one large, intimidating button. The honour of first activation goes to King Kazador, for his contributions to the Karak in general and for the steel that made it possible to work in the Rune of Gazul in particular, and you walk him through the process step by step, doing your best to ignore the curious stares of King Belegar and the Council behind you.

"Blue Lever, Red Lever, Grey Lever. Blue Lever clears the weather. It's already clear, so we set it to 'off'." Chunk. "Red Lever provides light. Sun's out, so we don't need it. Off." Chunk. "Grey Lever lets us aim. The shadow's not currently pointing at the Eastern Approach, so we set it to 'on'." Chunk, and a clack-clack as the bolts holding the console in place release, and with a gentle touch it starts moving along the metal track that rings the room. You surrender control of it to King Kazador, and he rolls it right with enthusiasm until it lines up with the half-dozen Broken Toof Orcs that Dreng's Rangers had captured for this purpose, who wriggled fruitlessly against the ropes holding them immobile. "Line up the mark on the top of the console with the line on the window. That aims it - there's a dial for inputting a compass position manually, but this is easier. Flip the 'Direction' switch when that's ready."

"What about angle?" he asks, peering with one eye along the mark.

"That's next. Got it?" He nods, and flips the switch, and another clack-clack signals that the console is once more locked in place. "Second is angle, which gives us our range. You could eyeball it, but we're a fixed point here, so the work's all been done in advance." You take a folded map from the small nook in the side of the console. "Pick a landmark - mountain or milestone - and we'll have the top of the shadow line up with it, or parallel to it if it's off-center."

He peers down the mark once more. "Fifth mountain on the right. With the arete on the right and the scree right in the middle of the base."

You consult the map. "39 degrees from Noon. Spin that dial there- that's the one- and flip the 'Angle' switch."

"Done."

"Third is the safety mechanism." The first two switches had a dial above them, but the third has only a recess. "If you check the other side of the panel, there's a series of crystals in labelled pockets. Take the one marked 'grobi', insert it into the socket, and flip the switch." He does so, and there's a click as the crystal is locked in place. "That's the failsafe. It can't fire without a crystal, and there's no crystals for Dwarves or Halflings or man." Unless you're piloting it, in which case it's controlled by your mind, not the console. You don't say that out loud. King Belegar knows that part, but not everyone has to. "We are now ready to fire."

"It only harms greenskins?" Prince Gotri says, somewhere between curious and dubious.

"I borrowed a goat from the Halflings - she's about halfway between the base of Karag Nar and the greenskins," you peer down, "and trying to chew through her tether, by the look of it. So we'll know for sure in just a moment." You nod to King Kazador. "Fire when ready, your majesty."

Apart from the click as the button sinks down as far as it will go, there's nothing but silence. But this is more than an absence of sound, this is silence that devours sound, somehow growing louder by the moment. Ulgu is siphoned from the Room of Dawn and Dusk and in the space between heartbeats, the sky is made to forget where the sun should be, and the shadow that was pointing straight north is now centered almost exactly on the greenskins below. The silence echoes, there's a hint of a scrape of metal on metal, and the shadow of Karag Nar deepens into a solid black...

And then, just as suddenly, the sun is back where it belongs and the quiet that grips the tower is the mere sound of eight people holding their breath.

"I don't know if it would frighten the greenskins, but it sure scares the hell out of me," King Kazador says, breaking the silence. "Did it work?"

You're already folding Ulgu, and the air bends as you create lenses between yourself and the test subjects. The eight of you peer down at an unperturbed goat, still obstinately munching on a rope that was specifically made to be unpalatable, and then you shift the lenses slightly to the now-unmoving greenskins. Their ragged clothing and the ropes that tie them are untouched, but every inch of visible flesh is burned a solid black. "It certainly did something."

Six sets of eyes peer down at them, but Gunnars needed only a glance, and you look over to see him nodding once in satisfaction.

---

Never before has the walk down the stairs of Karag Nar felt so long, and it's further still to reach the Eastern Approach. Pausing only to cast Sleep on the goat before it munches itself free and you have to explain what happened to the Halflings, you make your way down the path with two Kings and five fellow Councillors. You had braced yourself for the stench of scorched flesh, but even as you crouch down next to one, there's nothing, and your Magesight similarly can't detect any energies in them, neither that of a living creature nor any lingering presence from the activation of the Tower.

Prince Gotri, naturally, is the first to be overcome by curiosity and prod one of the corpses, and the dead Orc collapses gently in on itself. All that remains is an empty shell of ash, and the slightest touch is all it takes to rob the remains of even that cohesiveness.

"From the inside out," Gunnars says with grim satisfaction. "Zharrvengryn ignites the energies that bind body to soul."

---

There's a while of quiet silence as your group returns to the Karak, only broken by the bleating of the retrieved goat who apparently objects to being subjected to magic. King Kazador peels off from the group towards the Citadel to plan his latest foray against whoever catches his interest first, and the rest of the council meeting takes place on the march. Gunnars reports the Temple being on track to open in six months, and Princess Edda reports the reopening of the Barrows silver mine, though more time is needed to carefully probe its extent and reinforce the ancient shafts and tunnels before silver ore can start to be extracted.

"Dreng, how go the weapons?" King Belegar asks.

Dreng isn't the cheerful sort, but his frown is deeper than usual - though it takes a fair bit of familiarity with Dwarves to tell behind the beard. "Karak Azul is still trying to scale. They're too used to having nothing to work on but the relatively few supplies King Kazador's greenskin-worrying required. They've promised that every spare blacksmith Dwarf-hour will go towards supplying us, but their first priority is maintenance and supply for their Throng."

King Belegar frowns for a moment, then shrugs. "That's fair. Work with Edda on the Barrows, and if it's clear check on Karag Grim nearby, old records and stories tell of natural caves and it'd be an ideal position for beasts or greenskins to hunt miners from." Dreng nods and salutes. "Kazrik, what of Nuln?"

"The Imperial Gunnery School is opening up a branch in Karag Nar," he reports happily.

King Belegar almost misses a step, and the rest of you have to come to a sudden halt to keep from piling into him. "How?"

"Apparently the one thing that Luitpold and Konstantin agree upon is that they like us. We've got the full sixty cannon I was hoping for, and I also managed to secure three dozen mortars."

"I've got Clan Irkokri working on a battery platform for each of Karagril, Karag Lhune, and Karag Nar," Dreng says. "The entirety of Death Pass from the East Gate to the Ulrikadrin Passage will be in overlapping fields of fire, with the least protected part being where the Eastern Approach meets Death Pass, which will 'only' have fifteen cannon and twelve mortars able to get an angle."

"Very fine work. We need Death Pass to remain open." He thinks for a moment. "Head to Karaz-a-Karak and bring me a copy of every grudge levelled against an Ice Dragon. If it'd done anything recently I'd have heard about it, and anything older will be in their records. We'd likely have to see its markings before we can tell if it matches any of the records, but I want that information on hand. Gotri, the defences?"

"Run into roadblocks on the current project," he says shortly.

"Is the idea workable?" Prince Gotri nods. "And the grapecannon?"

"Fifteen at each front, including the Kvinn-Wyr underway."

"Then you've got another six months. Make it work." The other Councillors peel off, some going ahead to Karag Lhune and some turning towards the Citadel, and in a few moments you and King Belegar are left crossing the Eastern Valley at a more sedate pace. "I don't know what the hell I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't that. Terrifying, utterly terrifying. But I can live with it a lot easier than I could with a Waaagh or an Ogre tribe or who knows what else battering down the Eastern Gates. Excellent work." He turns to look up at the towers atop Karag Nar. "You really think you can extract Queekish from a Skaven?"

You nod confidently. "Not quickly or easily, but yes."

"Then do it. I've a feeling we'll need every advantage we can get when they stop tearing each other apart and turn towards us."

Personal Actions: you have four actions you can apply without engaging in overwork.
Current overwork status: [-] [  ] [  ]
Each box will be filled by one action of overwork, and will take the two turns after that to fade as you recover. The first box incurs no penalty. The second will give a -10 penalty to all actions during the first turn of recovery. The third will  give a -20 penalty to all actions on both turns of recovery. 
Overwork incurs no penalties on the turns taken, only on the turns recovering from it. You can take as many actions of overwork as you have unfilled boxes.
When you use overwork it fills the left-most empty box, so [-][ ][ ] becomes [-][+][ ], not [+][-][ ]. All boxes recover in parallel and independent from one another, but second and third apply maluses on your actions during that cooldown period.
