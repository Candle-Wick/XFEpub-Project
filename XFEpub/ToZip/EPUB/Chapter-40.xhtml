“Cadia…stands…,” the Cadian spat up at Abaddon’s infernal gaze, the unholy flames surrounding his entire body making even that last act of defiance be burnt to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“Cadia…<i>falls!”</i></b> the Despoiler growled, before simply stepping closer so that the sheer horrific presence of his person and all that he bore with him caused the flag-bearing Sergeant to be set aflame while his flesh twisted and warped from the vile touch of the Dark Gods.<br/>
<br/>
The shattered remains of the command center burned behind him, chaos space marines turning it over in order to be sure that every last defiant Imperial within was slaughtered with the greatest of impunity. But the Despoiler did not spare even a modicum of his thoughts upon such minor things, for his gaze was instead focused upon the dropship which had lifted off literally as he had emerged from the broken base he had teleported down into. The mind within that dropship was even now filled with fury and shame and grief at being forced into retreat, but Abbadon cared not for whatever litanies of hate and retribution were being spewed by the occupants of the Valkyrie.<br/>
<br/>
Why should he, when he could bring them down to face him <i>now</i>?<br/>
<br/>
<b>“<i>Bring it down</i>!”</b> he bellowed, and with but the pointing of the <i>Talon of Horus,</i> a screaming horde of daemons rose up behind him to spear towards the still accelerating ship.<br/>
<br/>
From the skies, they tore themselves free of the immaterium, and those creatures once trapped by the Banshee Stone and now bound by the sorceries of the Thousand Sons, fell upon the ship. They tore apart its engines, shredded its wings, and sent the whole thing falling towards the earth after but a few seconds of exposure and tearing at the hands of the creatures of the Warp. Yet instead of allowing it and the prize within to fall utterly to the earth and surely incinerate what he desired, another forceful pull of his hand and the energies he commanded sent the daemons to parody saviors, gently pulling the now gutted thing of metal towards him at breakneck pace.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when it slowly drifted before him, the guardsmen within of weaker will already clawing their eyes out and going insane, some mutating from sheer exposure to Chaos, Abbadon blinked once. The Valkyrie dropped the last few feet, a smoking wreck that would never fly again. To his side, Abbadon turned a small mote of his attention to the still smoking frame that was once Jarran Kell, and was now a creature far beyond a human’s simple comprehension. The Chaos Spawn still held the flag of Cadia, blackened now and burnt, not in a hand or claw but melded with the very twisted and now curled spine of the daemonic creature which had mutated as the soul of Kell was scoured by the Despoiler’s presence. As the sigil of Chaos slowly began to burn its way into the center of it, Abbadon’s lips might even have seen the thought of a ghost of a smile.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“Creed.” </b><br/>
<br/>
Abbadon said no more. He did not need to. The daemons under his command tore and pawed at the sides of the Valkyrie and ripped them asunder, revealing the smoke and blood choked inside and the bodies of the slain Cadians within. Yet one life, one soul, remained. Either by design or stubbornness, it did not matter. The <i>Talon of Horus</i> raised up, and with a clench of his fist that soul was lifted up and dragged out towards him. A minor application of will ensured that the physical warpstuff which wrapped about the arms and legs of the Lord Castellan of Cadia would not inflict upon him the same fate that had to his so beloved aid and friend.<br/>
<br/>
“Abbadon,” the man growled, his uniform torn, his lips bloodied, yet without a glimmer of fear in his eye.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“You made an admirable effort, wretch,”</b> Abbadon granted his foe the slightest of nods before he wrapped the <i>Talon of Horus</i> with incredible precision around Creed’s chest and throat.<br/>
<br/>
Then he stepped back, and turned about to show his work. The shattered fortresses. The predations of the Slaaneshi forces which had been once more cowed into submission, inflicted upon the dead and the dying of the entire burning city. Death Guard stomped about, phlegmatic laughter booming out of their plague-ridden throats as they fired bile spewers into the waterways and sewers and kill all who drank even a drop. Whole warbands of Khornate berserkers going wild upon all that they could find, even some other servants of Chaos ever since the Forsworn and their leader had been slain by the Minotaurs. Everywhere that Abbadon forced the Lord Castellan to look, was death, fire, and desecration. In point of fact, save for the most desperate of last stands, the fighting throughout the entire Kasr was all over.<br/>
<br/>
<b>“But you could not deny Chaos forever. As he learned,”</b> and then Abbadon tilted Creed so that he was forced to stare into the twisted and stretched morass of skin and bone which still held the vague shape of Kell’s screaming face before he was lifted up once more so that he was eye-to-eye with the Despoiler. <b>“As will you.”</b><br/>
<br/>
Yet just as Abbadon began to tighten his grip, he paused, and looked up in a mirror to Creed. The clouds of Cadia had left that place, what pure white fleeing before the twisting grip of Chaos itself it had seemed, and so afforded a clear sky with which to see not just the blazing Eye of Terror itself, but the many ships of the Chaos fleets under Abbadon’s control. In turn, this further allowed the sight of the sudden tearing open of the Warp itself as a great number of ships began to pull their way free. Many amongst them were of the Imperial Navy, but many bore the marks of the space marines. Strike cruisers and battle barges bearing the crests of a dozen new Chapters came to the fore, yet at the head of them all were ships bearing the sigils of every single one of the Clan Companies of the Iron Hands. Behind them came a brace of their Successors as well, following along like the dogs they were behind their failure of a sire Legion, dogs of a dead Primarch.<br/>
<br/>
“Heh…hehahahaaha!” Creed began to laugh and wheeze at the sight before Abbadon began to squeeze harder and harder on him, first forcing him to stop, and then with a final expression of strength tore the man to shreds not with the Chaos-tainted edges of his lightning claw, but with the sheer physical force of his grip.<br/>
<br/>
The Despoiler growled at the sight in orbit as ships began to appear at insanely close distances out of desperation to begin their invasion, and then let the few remaining meat chunks of the man who was Ursarkar E. Creed fall to the ground to be eagerly eaten up by the Chaos Spawn that was once his greatest friend. For a single moment he contemplated the vast machinations of his mind, and of his plans, of the pylons upon this world, and all of the Crimson Path. Drop pods rained down from the heavens, not to reinforce a fallen command center the bastions of Imperial forces remaining on a planet that was already half consumed by the flame of Chaos. Massive drop ships carrying fresh and bright souls loyal to the rotting Imperium began to land as well, despite the best efforts of his fleet. He could feel the flickering touch of the disgustingly <i>true faithful</i> as ships screaming invocations to the Corpse-Emperor as thousands of blazing souls came slamming down to guard pathetic temples and churches instead of any reasonable defensive position. <br/>
<br/>
<b>“Come then, slaves to a false God,”</b> Abbadon spread his arms wide, welcoming the latest sacrifices to his glory, <b>“COME TO MY CRUCIBLE!”</b></div>
