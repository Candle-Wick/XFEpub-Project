The Past And Present: Tyranids</b>â€‹</div> <br/>
Servos whined as Gabriel gingerly made his way through the <i>Litany of Fury's </i>halls, his steps forever harder and louder than they had been before...before. As he rounded a corner he paused to let a quietly whirring skull float lazily through the air past him with some message or another clutched with tiny intricate claws. For a wild moment melancholy whipped about him and he saw Isador - younger and unblemished by insanity and the disgusting taint of Chaos - and a far younger version of himself walking side by side down this very same corridor. Their mouths moved and their gestures were wild and free...but no sound came from them. A blink from his one remaining eye and a clicking whir as the bionic one did the equivalent and then it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
His steps picked up once more as he opened and clenched both hands repeatedly at his sides. Not out of any nervousness or irritation but instead out of sheer necessity. Both of his arms were the finest of bionics that Martellus could possibly craft for him and yet he knew they were not his own. Not yet. They hummed and clicked and whirred and he could not <i>feel</i> them as he would flesh and blood. As such since awaking and becoming Chapter Master he had spent every rare moment that he was able to squeeze out of his wearying schedule in the cages. Teasing, testing, training. Having to relearn more than two thirds of his body was a most uncomfortable experience and yet...another flicker of Isador and himself, this time as initiates, barely out of the Blood Trials. The two of them had been so joyous that at the success and had moved so awkwardly as their bodies suddenly rippled with changes.<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel sighed and paused as he reached his destination, where despite his own status amongst his brothers another <i>truly</i> held court so long as it was within such this one place. One hand - rippling metal and hidden mechanisms - pressed against the access panel. Steam and air hissed out as the heavy metal doors guarding the chamber slowly opened. Within this sacred place, Martellus flitted back and forth with a measured slowness as he carefully cleaned and repaired the mighty machine before him though his head tilted just enough to let Gabriel know that his presence was noted. Noted and subsequently ignored in favor of continuing his work.<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Gabriel. Why...have you come..."</b><br/>
<br/>
Captain Davian Thule, one of the few remaining Blood Ravens ensconced within the sarcophagus of a dreadnought, spoke in a voice that both boomed and at the same time was inextricably weary. The cleansing of the Chapter had been bloody indeed and it was little surprise that the survivors were as to a marine quite exhausted mentally and spiritually. For one who loved it so fiercely as Thule it was potentially even worse a trial than his near death by the tyranids. Gabriel at the least could still function with full lucidity and in his own body while Davian's own moments of full awareness were painfully fleeting. It could only be hoped that this was one of those times.<br/>
<br/>
"Greetings, my brother. How fares he, Martellus?" Gabriel looked towards the techmarine who had somehow gotten his legs hooked onto some sort of piping and hung upside down to adjust something or other on the dreadnought's back.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, Chapter Master. I shall be finished in less than an hour at this rate," came the muffled response.<br/>
<br/>
"Good...good."<br/>
<br/>
The moment stretched on, Martellus and his tools buzzing and sending sparks flying, Davian silent, and Gabriel rocking back on his newly bionic legs for a moment with both hands clasped behind his back.<br/>
<br/>
"Captain Thule, I wished to speak with you-,"<br/>
<br/>
<b>"The secrets of Kronus shall not pass my lips!"</b> the dreadnought abruptly boomed, entire frame shaking with emotion and sending Martellus clattering to the ground with a wild yelp. No weapons were currently attached but on sheer mass a dreadnought was a most sufficient weapon.<br/>
<br/>
"Captain Thule, please!" Martellus cried out as he dodged a giant foot which could have pulped him, armor and all.<br/>
<br/>
<b>"I will die before...before...I..."</b> Davian's voice and movements slowed, <b>"I will...who...what...I..."</b><br/>
<br/>
Gabriel bowed his head as the dreadnought drifted away. Both of his hearts thrummed and ached as he watched one of their greatest...be reduced to <i>this</i>. But he had come here for a reason, one he was determined to get answers for. The dataslates at his side utterly demanded it, demanded it for those who might have known best were gone from the Chapter perhaps for all time.<br/>
<br/>
"Captain Thule, I need to speak of you regarding the opening days of the Third Aurelian Crusade," he intoned, carefully watching as the movements of the dreadnought stilled.<br/>
<br/>
"<b>I...the...yes. The jungle fighting. Sent there by <i>Kyras</i>..."</b> the dreadnought trembled with fury again, but at the least it seemed to be helping him clear the fog.<br/>
<br/>
Internally, Gabriel sighed. Unfortunately some of his linked bionics assumed he meant for a real one which caused quite an interesting internal situation of air movement but one that he elected to ignore.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed. You along with a force of marines were sent by Kyras, nominally to conduct new Blood Trials, but instead..."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Twisted mockeries of life!!"</b> the dreadnought bellowed, the volume loud enough to likely explode a mere mortals eardrums. <b>"You felled me once, you shall never do so again xeno scum!</b>"<br/>
<br/>
Martellus had given up at this point at trying to finish up on the dreadnought and decided to simply move out of the way of the suddenly flailing Thule. His harness clicked as it scooped up his tools and despite the almost permanent helm of the techmarine Gabriel thought that he could perhaps sense that he was scowling at him. Disturbing one of his brothers, one of the holy ancients - despite their relative ages - was normally not done. Yet he <i>needed</i> answers. Cyrus had nothing for him, Martellus was not there, and Tarkus knew only that the dreadnought had been present. Diomedes had personally been mostly focused on the various foes at the time and squashing Eliphas once more.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, the tyranids. Reports stated that you and the rest of the marines there came under assault from some form of advanced organism, one that the ferals should not have been able to spawn."<br/>
<br/>
Thule's agitation faded once more, and the dreadnought turned towards him fully, and in that instant Gabriel <i>felt</i> the true full focus of the hero within.<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Yes. It was no Hive Tyrant. Too different, it's psychic might far more advanced and intricate. Where it walked, whole swarms and spawning pools were once more realigned underneath the Hive Mind. I slew it...but the fact that the tyranids could make such a thing at all beneath our eyes is dangerous."</b><br/>
<br/>
"Could you describe it any further?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Yes. I investigated on my own when...when the fog managed to clear. While Diomedes faced the traitors, I searched. What I found was disconcerting. A Hive Lord is a form of bio-form that the Hive Mind itself has a personal link to in excess of that of a mere Hive Tyrant."</b><br/>
<br/>
"As I suspected then. I needed another to confirm my suspicions and of the force Kyras sent to Typhon you were the only survivor from the tyranid assault."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"It is to be feared. It mobilized and reinvigorated the tyranids of Typhon faster than it had any right to. At the least...that world's complement of the blasted things shall trouble us no longer."</b><br/>
<br/>
"And yet they remain. On Calderis. Potentially on Aurelia and Meridian. Most certainly on the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i>."<br/>
<br/>
<b>"It remains in system still?"</b><br/>
<br/>
"Aye," Gabriel nodded.<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Hmph. Know this Gabriel. I accompanied Aramus on far too many expeditions onto that vessel. Be thankful you yourself have not had to. Too many Blood Ravens have died there already."</b><br/>
<br/>
"I understand. Thank you, Davian. I shall leave you to Martellus's work and your sleep," the Chapter Master bowed slightly at the waist as he exited the chamber.<br/>
<br/>
As he thumped down the hallways of the <i>Litany of Fury</i>, his eyes narrowed, though he nearly stumbled as his bionic one took the neural command far too literally and suddenly he found one half of his vision examining the intricate dust mites of the deck plates beneath him with a series of varied scans of which thermal was only one of. Straightening and commanding his eye to reverse itself, his thoughts once more turned towards the tyranids. Remnants of Hive Fleet Leviathan, they were dangerous enough, but the fact that they had created this 'Hive Lord' disturbed him. There remained tyranids in Subsector Aurelia and he was disinclined to let them have the time to try and create another.<br/>
<br/>
They would have to be dealt with, and soon.</div>
