    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">Izuku rolled his eyes fondly as he caught the Everstone and put it in his backpack, watching Mighty flex in his evolved form of a Machoke. Show off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"He, ah, has a bit of an ego on him, doesn't he?" Kahili asked in amusement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"A bit?" Izuku said, "He's a major egotist."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Choke!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Non-Egotists don't wear Everstones so they can evolve "at the right time"! Izuku shot back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Choke," Mighty huffed, crossing his arms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Anyways," Kahili drawled, dropping another ball and driving it into the air, where it spat out a red bird, "Oricorio, Revelation Dance!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Cross Chop!" Izuku ordered. Mighty lunged forwards, arms forming an X, and slammed into the Baile Style Oricorio before it could finish Its dance, "Finish this quickly, Mighty, Thunder Punch blitz!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Electricity built up, muscles bulged and-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kahili smirked, a nasty expression for such a pretty face, and Izuku felt his gut drop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Just like we practiced, Oricorio, Feather Dance into Air Slash Into Revelation Dance!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A three move combo?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Mighty, get back!" Izuku called, and Mighty immediately jumped back and away from Oricorio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Got you," Kahili said, "Teeter Dance!*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oricorio began to dance, a swaying, drunken thing that caused both Izuku and Mighty to stagger in a daze.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Damn- damn it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"And Revelation Dance!" Kahili said with a finger snap, the dance changing and letting Izuku shake off the daze. But it was too late, Mighty was consumed by the flames.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Mighty, return!" Izuku ordered, pulling Mighty into his Luxury Ball at the same time he threw out another, "Dudette, Stealth Rock, then Thunder Bolt!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dudette appeared, punching the ground and causing spikes of stone to fly into the air, before lightning sparked between her crystals and fired at Oricorio, knocking it out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All for One tented his hands, watching the pirated broadcast of the "elite four challenge". So many powers on display made his Quirk itch, he wanted them, he wanted them so badly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Doctor," he said, without changing his tone, "Do you still have those contacts at I-Island?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Melissa watched Izuku send out Dudette, knowing Mighty was probably throwing a fit in his PokeBall even though it was the right choice. Dudette had multiple type advantages against flying types, she would do better than he could.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, it was better to save Mighty for Olivia, where he would have the type advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"<i>Out of curiosity,</i>" the commentator said, "<i>Does the color of the PokeBall they're throwing out mean something? Midoriya's are black for example.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>"Izuku is using Luxury Balls,"</i> Leon explained, <i>"As the name implies, they're more luxurious than regular PokeBalls. You normally see them with more rich trainers, so the fact that he uses them is likely a personal choice</i>."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'<i>And Kahili?</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"<i>Kahili, who I would like to apologize for calling Kahlil earlier,</i>" Leon said, <i>"Uses Ultra Balls. Those are normally seen with most high end trainers. I use them, for example. They're harder to break out of, so they're more efficient at catching Pokemon. It's why I said Izuku using Luxury Balls is likely a personal choice, they aren't as efficient.</i>"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"<i>I see,</i>" the commentator said in a tone that made it clear he didn't see at all, "<i>That won't affect the tournament at all, will it?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Shouldn't, beyond Izuku's pokemon being more well rested,</i>" Leon said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you asked Dudette what her role in the team was, she would tell you she didn't have a role. She didn't have the child bond Blanket did, she didn't have the fanatical loyalty from being accepted of Pikakyu, she didn't want to find her son like Mea, or show off like Mighty, or to be a knight like Gardy. She just… she was friends with Izuku, of course, but she didn't have any particular reason for following him like the others did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that made her the most loyal, maybe it didn't. She really didn't know. Was loyalty without a cause more or less loyal than loyalty without a reason.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bah, this was why she didn't like being in her PokeBall for too long, she got all comfy and sleepy and then the existential questions came up. Ten years old was too young to be having an existential crisis. Just about right to have a midlife crisis, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, look, she was flying through the air. Looks like Izuku had decided to fight with her this round. That was good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dudette popped out of her Luxury Ball with a stifled yawn, immediately following Izuku's orders to throw up a curtain of sharp rocks and then throw out a bolt of lightning that knocked out the opponent's Oricorio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Let's turn up the heat then," the opponent said, placing a ball on the ground and driving it into the arena, a Toucannon flying out and immediately beginning to dodge the sharp rocks that quivered in place before launching at him, "Ready, Toucy? It's time for our secret move! First-"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She crossed her arms in the familiar X of a Z-move, energy flowing from her to the dodging Toucannon. Then she spread her arms wide, miming a bird in flight. Toucannon turned and launched upwards into the air, so high they became a spec in the sky. There was a low howl on the wind, slowly growing in pitch until it became a loud whistle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"-Supersonic Skystrike! And now, Beak Blast, Toucy!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A move during a Z-Move!? What-?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The air around Toucannon lit on fire, the whistle turning into a low drone before it smashed into Dudette with the force of a cruise missile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dudette dug her feet into the ground the best as she could, pulling her fist into a haymaker and attacking without orders, the Thunder Punch knocking Toucannon back and giving Dudette time to breath as Toucannon lifted himself back into the air.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Izuku stared at the crater in the arena as the crowd roared, unable to keep the surprise off his face. To use a move during an already exhaustive Z-Move and turn it into what was basically an entirely new move…<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slowly, haltingly, the look of shock faded, replaced with a grin of pure excitement. His heart began to beat in his throat, and Izuku laughed despite himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
…Was this what they meant when they said the Elite Four were the best trainers in Alola? Izuku had never considered doing something like that! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, two could play that game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Dudette!" Izuku called to the slightly smoldering Graveler, "We're gonna try something new!'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Izuku's foot dragged across the ground as he entered a wide stance, swapping the crystal in his Z-Power Ring as he went. Him and Dudette crossed their arms, Z Power flowing from him to her, then they twisted their arms into the shape of a thunderbolt as one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ready?" Izuku called, electrical energy crackling around him and Dudette as one. Dudette nodded, a full body thing that wasn't necessary in the state they were in, "Gigavolt Havoc Thunder Punch!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Dodge it, Toucy!" <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Drop the Stealth Rocks on him, Dudette, don't let him dodge!" Izuku ordered, the rocks falling and smashing into the ground to pin Toucy in place. Then, a punch with 1,000,000,000 volts of electricity slammed into Toucy and knocked him out of the arena and out of consciousness.</div>
