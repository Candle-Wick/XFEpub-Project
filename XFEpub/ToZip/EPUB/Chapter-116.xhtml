    <h2>The Battle of Karagril, Part 4</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Unprepared
[*] Clan Mors



From your position at the base of Karagril all you can see is its towering height, but you know that just on the other side of Death Pass is Karak Drazh, and the entire might of the Red Fang Orcs. "Gyrocopters, siege weapons, Runelords. The caldera is a death trap for any enemy that tries to cross it. And Kvinn-Wyr is handled. Our only dangerous fronts are against Mors under the caldera, and against Moulder in the under-Karagril. That's manageable. Pushing downwards, though..."

King Belegar grimaces. "New fronts with Skryre and the Red Fangs."

"Skryre might stay focused on Mors, but whoever controls under-Karagril is going to have the full attention of Karak Drazh. That Karagril was full of them shows they've got ambitions here. So it comes down to Moulder and Mors. If we reassert the status quo, maybe Moulder is distracted but Skryre and Eshin won't be, and that's two and a half on one, and once Mors is stamped out we're likely to get their full attention. But if we hit Moulder enough to crumple them, and Mors expands into the under-Karagril..."

"All three fronts would be against Clan Mors," King Belegar says slowly, distaste clear on his face but still giving it consideration. Pitting enemies against each other was Ranger tactics, which he'd come to accept. Seeking for a specific enemy to prosper was a step further than that.

"Clan Moulder was definitely moving to try to invade the Karag proper before Mors and the Red Fangs got involved," you say, trying to reshape the issue so it fits better in the Dwarven mind. "A decisive counterstrike would discourage other factions from trying the same."

King Belegar looks up at the Karag towering above the two of you, lost in thought. "No," he says finally. "Comforting, but false. I'll spread the lie for everyone else but won't swallow it myself. We do this to empower Clan Mors, and draw out the Skaven stalemate as long as possible."

---

Properly purging every greenskin from the nooks and crannies of Karagril will be a project of months, but purging enough to be mostly safe turning your backs to it is a matter of mere hours, especially with you pointing King Kazador and his enthusiastic cohort towards any concentration of Orcs large and confident enough to sprout a Waaagh field. You've read more than a few College accounts of the Waaagh field and even a third-hand description from a Bretonnian Damsel, but though most describe it as something halfway between heat haze and a thundercloud, none of them speak of being able to spot it without line of sight, nor do they describe the semi-metallic tang on your tongue that you use to dowse out the direction of the Orcs. Perhaps this is a manifestation of your growing magical acuity, but you suspect it owes at least part of its existence to Mork using your soul as a hand-puppet.

That's a matter for later, and as the forces gather once more you look over Dreng's shoulder as he tallies the casualties. Shockingly light among the mercenaries, which will give Eight Peaks' reputation among sellswords an even further boost, but while they'd likely prove invaluable if the Red Fangs beat Clan Mors to the punch, you're not sure if they should be involved in the fighting against Moulder. The Undumgi could be relied upon to keep quiet, but you doubt those that maintain the Conspiracy of Silence would appreciate a swarm of well-paid mercenaries telling stories of battles with ratmen. Most were likely to return to the Border Princes where gossip travels no faster than a saunter, but some would take their pay and use it to buy a life in the Empire, where the soil was richer and extinction was an occasional concern instead of a regular event.

Then again, perhaps a few dire warnings and veiled threats would seal their mouths. You're still not quite comfortable with weighing human lives against Dwarven ones, but their contribution would prevent total deaths and how did one measure that against the very small but admittedly real chance of a mercenary's tall tale catching on and fracturing the veil of secrecy the Skaven think they have?

[ ] The mercenaries should not fight Skaven at all.
They'll not see any Skaven, but will be on hand to fight against the Red Fangs if it becomes necessary.
[ ] The mercenaries should join the fight against Skaven.
You'll give them Skaven 101 beforehand, and swear them to secrecy and give some suitably dire threats afterwards.
[ ] The mercenaries should stay in reserve.
If the battle against Clan Moulder starts going bad, the mercenaries will be brought in. If they're not needed, they'll never see any Skaven.


There's also the matter of how you'll contribute. You've made a habit of assassination and you like the idea of adding a Warlord to your tally of Warbosses, but you're not sure if that's a good idea before you fill the gaps in your spellbook that caused your recent troubles. On top of that, you'd be operating blind instead of with the benefit of having mapped the tunnels in advance. Perhaps it might be better to contribute in some other way.

[ ] Assassination
See if you can bag a fourth general before the day draws to a close.
[ ] Sabotage
There's sure to be plenty of beasts to rile up or let loose, and possibly powder stores or warptech weapons as well.
[ ] Interference
Interfere with the Red Fang assault, so they can't beat Clan Mors to moving into Clan Moulder's territory.
[ ] Treasure Hunt
Last call. Grab Johann and see if you can steal, capture, stash, kidnap, or otherwise acquire anything interesting before Clan Moulder is removed from Eight Peaks.
[ ] Line of Battle
- [ ] With King Kazador
Likely to be where the fighting is thickest.
- [ ] With Dreng
Likely to be in the center of things.
- [ ] With King Belegar
Likely to be where most needed.
- [ ] With the mercenaries.
- [ ] With your Ducklings.
If you do not escort them, the Journeymen will not take part in this battle.
[ ] Flanking
Lurk near the battlefield and seek a place where a sudden terrifying sword-wizard will cause the most havoc.
[ ] Remain in reserve
You'll be in place to react quickly to anything unexpected as soon as news reaches you.
[ ] Other (write in)
