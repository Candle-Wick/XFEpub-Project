    <h2>Assault on Drakenhof, Part 6: The Siege</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[*] Leave a garrison; it is now de facto Stirland, not just de jure.
-[*] Medium Garrison - 6k men, 20 cannon.
[*] Nothing has changed. We have cannon, we have dragon. Castle Drakenhof falls.
[*] Execute him publicly, in the traditional way. Burn him at the stake. (+morale)



The pyre has been set up in the open plain outside the city walls, deliberately close to the gate where so many lost their lives, with the necromancer already tied firmly to the stake and the wood stacked high around him and doused in lamp oil, and a brazier set up nearby. He had awoken, briefly, at the preparations, and passed out as the most painful of them were inflicted. No matter. He'll awaken soon enough.

Even with Army of Stirland reduced by almost half, and significant portions of what remain busy elsewhere, the crowd arrayed before you is of breathtaking size. Thousands of men gather in the fading light, summoned by the messages relayed down the ranks: the execution of a captured necromancer will be occurring, and all who wish to attend are welcome. Blood, bandages, and distant stares are the fashion of the day, and you're no exception, since the Shallyan doctors finally gathered their nerves and did their timid best to convince you to let them bind your wounds, and you didn't have the strength to resist.

The opportunity exists, you dimly recognize, to deliver some speech, to fire the crowd up with thoughts of vengeance. But at your best you are no great public speaker, and this is far from your best. You hurt, inside and out, and like the men arrayed before you, you yearn for warmth and sleep and you're not going to get anywhere near enough of either.

So you keep things as simple as possible. "This," you call out, "is a necromancer. The penalty for necromancy, as we all know, is death." You turn to the pyre, regarding the man tied atop it; his mouth is very firmly gagged and his fingers broken to prevent any last-minute spellcasting, and you can barely hear his muffled attempts at screaming from where you are as he thrashes helplessly against the bindings. "The corpses he defiled took a great many of our comrades from us. And they took the life of the Elector Count Abelhelm Van Hal." You're hugely relieved that your voice doesn't crack at that. He can take so much, you reflect, and you can only take his life once. It will have to do. "The penalty for every one of those lives taken, is death."

There are words for this, for ordering an execution; ritual and formality used by judges and witch hunters alike. Van Hal would know the words, but you don't.

So you look at the man, one of the necromancers that raised and directed the horde that had cost you and Stirland so much, and say nothing. You take the torch from the brazier, walk up to him, and hold it to the kindling. It takes barely a second to catch, and you drop the torch and back away as the flames start to climb, banishing the evening chill. You turn and regard the gathered men, whose eyes are universally locked onto the pyre as the necromancer thrashes and screams into his gag. Some few are sickened, but most watch with grim satisfaction. These men are Stirlanders, and have lived in the shadow of Sylvania their entire lives, as their parents have and as their children will. After today, Sylvania will have one less horror to inflict upon the innocent.

You turn back to the pyre, catching glimpses of the necromancer's terrified and agonized expression through the rising flames, and smile.

There's a thousand steps to garrisoning a town, and though no one man in the Army of Stirland can be said to know all of them, everyone knows their role and that of their direct subordinates, and that's apparently enough. Houses are turned into barracks, warehouses into hospitals, taverns into headquarters, and by midnight there's Stirlandian troops patrolling the walls, and by torchlight dwarvern winches lower dwarven cannon and raise in place a score of Imperial greatcannon.

The tricky part, or so you gather, are the populace of the town hosting the troops. Even on friendly soil there's dozens of tricky little issues to be navigated, and on unfriendly soil the issues remain but with added urgency. Thankfully, it seems that the populace of this town come pre-cowed - the fanatics perished at the blades of the Army of Stirland and the cannonbolts of Zhufbar, those that remain are the regular townsfolk, who scrape what living they can from this blighted land and try to avoid the attention of whatever inhuman predator currently claims the title of their ruler. Their natural state is terrified obedience, and the martial law of an occupying force is, if anything, an improvement.

(You, of course, don't buy the 'poor victim Sylvanian' act for one minute, and instruct the officers to be left behind to be suitably cautious. The men are garrisoned together in one quarter of the town, and any of the townsfolk who try to cross into that quarter are to be given one warning before being riddled with crossbow bolts.)

There's nothing for you to do after you give the order, and that's a problem. You ache for sleep, but you don't dare stop. So you make a nuisance of yourself looking over shoulders and making sure things are getting done that are indeed getting done. You're not the only one going without sleep, but the men are resolved, the halflings are determined, the dwarfs refuse to acknowledge the hardship and the elf claims he can rest half of his brain at a time, though you're mostly sure he's just messing with you.

So at first light of dawn the remainder of the Army of Stirland marches, and with it marches the combined Throng of Zhufbar and Karak Kadrin, the Rangers of the Moot, one Knightly Order and representatives from four more, the tattered remnants of the Altdorf Regiment of Honour, and one elf atop one dragon.

Spoiler: Castle Drakenhof










As the morning wanes, the ultimate target of this crusade grows ever larger on the horizon. Perched atop a lonely mountain jutting out from the World's Edge mountain range, the castle starts high above the landscape and climbs higher still. Even from atop your horse, you can hear the unsure muttering in the ranks. Seen through their eyes, you can understand it. Though the castle compares unfavourably to the Imperial Palace or the Grand Cathedral in Altdorf, it easily outstrips any structure in Stirland. The winding path to the gate, and a second winding path from the enormous courtyard to the castle proper, would be a nightmare to assault. Even the most inept of defenders could hold off any number of attackers for as long as they damn well pleased.

Castle Drakenhof has stood for over a thousand years. It is older than Stirland's claim over Sylvania, older than the von Carsteins that made it their home. The soldiers of the Army of Stirland, and you'd wager the 'Elector Countess' herself, believe that to be proof that it cannot be taken by force of arms.

What they don't realize is this: that of the many things Castle Drakenhof predates, one very important milestone is the introduction of gunpowder.

You look past the worried men to the baggage train, where over one hundred blackpowder siege weapons are being pulled, push, carried, and generally manhandled (and dwarfhandled) towards Castle Drakenhof, and a grim smile returns to your face.

Goal:
[ ] The confirmed death of the Elector Countess.
[ ] The sacking of Castle Drakenhof.
[ ] The taking of Castle Drakenhof at least somewhat intact.
[ ] The complete destruction of the keep of Castle Drakenhof.
[ ] The complete destruction of the entirety of Castle Drakenhof.
[ ] The complete destruction of the mountain that Castle Drakenhof is built upon.
[ ] The exacavation of a pit on the site where the mountain that Castle Drakenhof was built upon used to stand.

Deployment:
[ ] Leave it to the human professionals.
[ ] Leave it to the dwarven professionals.
[ ] Leave it to the halfling professionals?
[ ] Write in.

The Elf Factor:
[ ] Unleash him early and often.
[ ] Keep him in reserve for now.
[ ] Use him to counter any non-trivial sally attempt or any other counterattack.

Response to Offensive Magic:
[ ] Treat it as enemy artillery and counter-battery accordingly.
[ ] Unleash Asarnil on it.
[ ] Attempt to counter it yourself.


- For deployment, assume a circular mountain base surrounded by forest; small hills and rises can be found if desired. A throng of approx 12k dwarves can pretty much clear an arbitrary amount of forest as needed.
