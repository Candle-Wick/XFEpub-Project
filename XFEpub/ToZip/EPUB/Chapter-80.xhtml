    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: Scouting Karag Lhune, Part 3</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] A fire among the haphazardly stacked doom diver wings will neutralize the threat, and judging by how high they're stacked near the torches, it may even be thought an accident.
[*] Advance deeper into Karag Lhune.



A wall bracket built to hold a single torch was never meant to stand up to the entire bodyweight of a wizard, and after a moment of inelegant dangling the metal pulls loose from the wall. You allow the torch to follow the call of gravity, and backpedal quickly as the wings catch almost instantly, the fire leaping merrily from stack to stack. What you had taken to be some sort of wool or linen is, on closer inspection, a sort of woven mycelium fiber, which you suspect to be the same material that the characteristic robes of the Night Goblins are woven from. But you have only a moment to examine the as-yet unburned set of wings, as the fire begins to rage out of control and you make good your escape. As you reach the spiralling staircase and begin your descent, you can hear shouts of alarm as the growing crackling of the fire alerts the few sober goblins to the danger. For a moment or two you hear voices rise over the sounds of burning as blame is thrown back and forth, and then it is masked by layers of stone as you progress downwards.

[Rolling...]

The staircase eventually ends in what feels like the depths of the earth but is more likely to be level with where the secondary peak joins with the rest of the mountain. You enter into a long, wide corridor made of dwarf-shaped stone but criss-crossed with tunnels made by cruder hands, and lit by patches of phosphorescent fungi. Every so often smaller tunnels of dwarf manufacture branch off, but the Khazalid that most likely once gave directions has been obliterated by carvings of glyphs and orc deities, so you remain on the larger corridor. Echoing through the tunnels are the movements and voices of goblins, so tangled in their own echoes you cannot guess as to how near or far they would be. Eventually the corridor widens, then widens again, and you eventually see why: an enormous set of towering steel doors, marked by runes taller than you that glow with bound energy. Scorch marks in the stone and the occasional crunch of bone and squish of flesh underfoot suggests that the door reacts poorly to those that would attempt to breach it, and that this hasn't dissuaded the Karak's trespassers from trying.

The only non-magical rune on the door is one of the few you recognize on sight, one you've seen chiefly on the bodies of tattooed doomseekers: the Rune of Grimnir, Ancestor God of warriors and oathkeeping. Most likely this is the entrance to the Hall of Oaths, where fealty to the King is recorded and those slain in battle are memorialized. But you don't have time to sightsee, you are here to blaze a trail for the oncoming vanguard, who should be setting off about now, if your gut feel for time passed is correct. If the ancient tales you heard of the Karak are accurate, somewhere on this same level are the Chiselwards, which were once the creche, orphanage and school of the Karak. Below you should be Temple of Grungni, chiefest of the Ancestor Gods, and below that the Royal Armouries that you can only pray are still sealed. And above you would be the Hall of the Moon, once named for the mountain (Karag Lhune translates roughly to 'Moon Mountain') but now, you suspect, better known for the Crooked Moon tribe that call these parts of the Karak home. This Hall should be parallel to the King's Gates, and as such is intended to be the first target of the oncoming onslaught.

Having gained some approximation of your bearings, you can now decide what your priority will be.

[ ] Head upwards to the Hall of the Moon, to scout the defences of the Crooked Moon Tribe.
[ ] Head upwards to the King's Gates, to scout the immediate defences of the King's Gates.
[ ] Stay on this level and scout the Chiselwards, once a sprawling network of sleeping quarters and classrooms.
[ ] Go downwards to the Temple of Grungni, to ensure that both temples of Karag Lhune remain sealed.
[ ] Go downwards to the Armoury, to ensure that the ancient armaments that were sealed within remain so.
[ ] Go downwards and seek any sign of the boundary of the territory of the Crooked Moon Tribe, with which you can estimate their numbers and strength.

- If there are no delays, you estimate you'll have time to scout three of these and meet the oncoming forces at the Gates. You are currently voting for the next place you visit, and future votes will have an option to end the scouting and go to meet the vanguard.
- Alternately, you could scout two and retrace your steps to the landing pad, and meet with the vanguard before they enter the Gates. It may be possible to slip out of the Gates from the inside, but it will also be riskier.
- If you can report that both Temples remain sealed, it will encourage the dwarves to fight harder to capture them. If the Temple of Grungni has been tainted and you report that, it will fill the dwarves with thoughts of vengeance.
- The Chiselwards are the largest piece of real estate in Karag Lhune, and you have no way of knowing what use the goblins have put it to.
