    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: Scouting Karag Lhune, Part 1</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Going in solo to scout enemy positions.



After the Council of War, Halken Stonebeard takes you aside, gruffly introduces you to those Clan Angrund Longbeards rivalling him in age, and together they descend into a guided reminiscence of tales they heard from those that were Longbeards when they were young. Unfortunately, these reminiscences are long on descriptions of architectural extravagance and short on topographical minutiae, and the useful notes you walk away with are short in length and small in number.

Before you set off, you check in your Journeymanlings.

Esbern and Seija did not bother to wash the blood of battle from themselves before tending to wounded mounts. Seija's magics make her uniquely suited to this, but what Esbern lacks in spells he makes for in his bond with the beasts, keeping them calm and cooperative as more mundane assistance is applied. From their reports, their contribution to the battle itself was minimal as the greenskin lines broke before they reached them. While they had built up more than enough goodwill to ride double with the Knights, they hadn't much experience with pursuing a routing target, and between them their spear and arrows accounted for only a handful of the enemy.

Panoramia is deep in lively debate with a chaotic crowd of miners and halflings around an excavation that is apparently hoped will eventually reach groundwater. Progress is slow due to the necessity of avoiding any preexisting tunnels or caverns, but what a dwarf considers to be slow digging and what you would consider it is very different, as already the shaft descends far below the point where the bottom can be seen. Debate at the surface is apparently based on the level of precaution that would be required to guarantee the purity of the water, with the dwarves advocating for boiling, the halflings championing some sort of sand filtration method, and Panoramia taking it all in with fascination. You manage to snag her attention for a moment or two, and she tells you that her time spent with the Rangers was apparently an incredible success, with the black lotus causing havoc in the battle above as wounded greenskins turned on their allies in poison-induced madness. Between this and her spells causing thorned plants to rampage far above, they were able to match the rout at ground level with one above.

Maximilian is celebrating with the human forces, who apparently also claim credit for the victory in the ramshackle catwalks above. You refrain from commenting and allow them to tell you of their archery duels where mundane arrows of Stirlandian archers were joined by silver arrows formed of Chamon. You smile, and nod, and move on to where Johann observes and occasionally assists (in the 'pass me that spanner' kind of way) in the maintenance of the siege engines, and are once more able to hold your tongue as you hear of how the volleys of stones and bolts raked the foes above the army and forced them into a retreat.

You turn your eyes upwards to where those with heads for heights are dismantling the ramshackle greenskin constructions and revealing untouched dwarven stonework below, and ponder this apparent three-fold victory. Eventually, you shrug. Let everyone believe they were the linchpin if it makes them happy.

You've heard tales of the amphitheatre at the heart of Karak Eight Peaks, an enormous flat plain surrounded by mountaintops formed first by nature and then by dwarven artifice. Where reality differs from what you imagined is that the Eight Peaks do not form a perfect circle, or even an oval. Instead the triad of Kvinn-Wyr, Karag Nar, and your target of Karag Lhune jut out from the circle, with the Citadel standing between this secondary valley and the rest of the inner land of the Karak. The Citadel is the natural gathering point for any greenskin counterattack upon the East Gate, and you'd be shocked if there weren't dozens or even hundreds of pairs of eyes on you as you walk outside the freshly-built gates of the innermost set of East Gate fortifications. That is, however, a problem you're uniquely suited to solving. Ulgu leaps to obey your will, and the bewildering influence of Take No Heed wraps around you. For those trying to make out a single figure at extreme distance, you feel confident that this will keep their eyes from settling on you. You mount your Shadowsteed and set off across the barren valley, idly wondering if whatever name it once bore is still known to the dwarves.

You wonder too at the name of the King's Gates. You've been told that the King's Hall was below the Citadel, and the throne room far below that, so it would make more sense to you if the King's Gates were part of the Citadel. But that gate is apparently called the Great Gate of Defiance, although none could tell you whether they were always called that or became known as that during the tragic last stand of the Karak, thousands of years ago. The Temple of Grungni and the Hall of Oaths were both within Karag Lhune. Did 'King' refer to Grungni, the ultimate King of the dwarf pantheon? Was there some ceremonial procession of the King that passed through the gates and ended in the Hall of Oaths?

You put the musings out of your mind as your ever-efficient Shadowsteed reaches the foot of Karag Lhune. Carved into its face, reaching near halfways up its stupendous height, are stairs. What must be thousands of them, each slightly shorter than ones made for human stature. You consider the experience of climbing the damn things yourself, and are immediately thankful that your steed is not bound by the limitations of mortal beasts as it begins the climb for you.

The long ascent gives you plenty of time to study a battery of greenskin contraptions built into a secondary peak of the mountain, long ago flattened to act as a landing pad for the vast, lumbering airships that once linked the Karaz Ankor. They appear to be no more than an extremely crude ballista or even an oversized sling, tilted upwards for extra range in such a way that if it weren't for their unique ammunition, it would be nigh impossible to hit anything with any degree of accuracy. But the 'doom divers' make accuracy immaterial, steering themselves over their target then folding their wings to transform themselves into a delivery mechanism for as much force as gravity can impart upon them. No doubt they are currently within the mountain, doing whatever it is such creatures would do when they are not being launched into the sky, and all that remains above is a single unfortunate greenskin, scowling and squinting in the sunlight as he makes a token effort at keeping a lookout. You watch his eyes slide off you several times, the creature's hideous face crinkling in confusion each time before it returns to skiving off and feeling sorry for itself.





At long last, you reach the final stair and dismount your steed to stand upon the landing of the King's Gates, recessed deep into the mountain's side. Perhaps all your time spent among dwarves is having an influence upon you, because you feel a stirring of anger at the sight of ancient dwarven stonework overlaid with the crude efforts of the greenskin, and you return the scowl of the totem to a greenskin god with one of your own. Where once a nigh-impenetrable gate of stone and metal once stood, now only wood prevents any who wish to enter from doing so, and through the crooked gates you can see an enormous room full of firelight and movement, emitting a babble of high-pitched voices that suggest goblins rather than any larger greenskin variety.

You turn your eyes to the banner of the Crooked Moon, which contrasts sharply with the Broken Toof that the greenskins of the East Gates were flying. Night Goblins, then, or at the very least their subjects or allies - the watchgoblin you saw earlier lacked the characteristic robes that the Night Goblins wore when above ground. Though there are no greenskins on watch out here on the landing, there seems to be enough light and activity inside that you'd be unable to enter the gates without being spotted. The Entrance Hall, you were told, holds innumerable branching side-passages that you'd be able to find cloaking darkness within, but you'd have to reach them first.

Frowning, you turn your head to the secondary peak where the solitary watchgoblin still suffers in the sunlight, and examine the unworked stone that it is built upon. You may not have had much experience at mountaineering, but you are light, fit, and capable of Skywalking, which leads you to believe it would be possible to reach this alternate entry point. The downside, of course, would be that you'd have to find your way back to the entrance you currently stand at for the scouting you do to have immediate value to the vanguard, who will be setting off from the East Gates shortly.

You look down from the landing at the valley stretching out before you and weigh your options.

[ ] Try to peek into the gates without being seen, then use Doppelganger to take on the appearance of someone on the other side, and use that and Take No Heed to slip through.
[ ] Use Doppelganger to take on the appearance of the watchgoblin, and use that and Take No Heed to slip through.
[ ] Try to peek into the gates without being seen, and use Bewilder to try to start enough chaos inside that you'd be able to slip through easily with Doppelganger and Take No Heed.
[ ] Disregard stealth entirely and walk through the gates, trusting in your combat ability to get through the entrance hall before reinforcements arrive.
[ ] Disregard stealth entirely and gallop through the gates, streaking through whatever is on the other side on Shadowsteed before any of the greenskins can react.
[ ] Use Pall of Darkness to create a cloud of impenetrable darkness just inside the gates, and dart through it.
[ ] Enter the gates, use Pall of Darkness on the main source of light, and use the resulting darkness to get through.
[ ] Climb from the King's Gates to the landing pad, kill or evade the solitary guard, and infiltrate through there.

- Shadowcloak wouldn't be enough to hide you if you were illuminated and in plain sight. Take No Heed wouldn't work, as a human in a hall of greenskins stands out too much to be disregarded by even the most disinterested observer. Substance of Shadow requires you to remain in darkness. 
- The invasion force will be visible enough that the alarm will be raised here long before they arrive, so maintaining the element of surprise will be entirely for your own benefit.
- If you wish to take out the Doom Diver Catapults, vote to infiltrate through the landing pad and a secondary vote will be held to decide what, exactly, you will do to them.
