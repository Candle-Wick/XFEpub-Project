<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>009.M42 Interlude: Wrath Of The Red</b>​</div> <br/>
The<i> Allfather’s Honor</i> burned, cracked almost completely in half with sheer force that had been unleashed upon it. Around it, the vessels of the Dark Angels not already destroyed were doing their best to flee as the daemonships that had come screaming from out of the immaterium surrounded them. Of the Inquisitorial ships, a massive wave of daemons had overwhelmed them, the plagues of Mortarion rusting away the very hull plates to allow them in while driving the crewmembers mad with pain and sickness. The purest of fury that Khorne could grant whether wanted or not drove the ships of the Imperial Navy mad, and their guns fired endlessly in all directions including into their own brethren.<br/>
<br/>
All fled from the site of the great rent tear in reality that had been ripped open from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you see, do you see how they FLEE BEFORE ME!?” the daemon prince screamed, madness rippling through him reducing his frame to nearly splitting apart before the moment passed.<br/>
<br/>
A twist of his will, and the warp parted before him further, allowing a curious leviathan to be sucked into the battered frame of the <i>Allfather’s Honor</i> and possess it completely and totally. The daemon shrieked in outrage as it was bound with the skill and power that none other in the galaxy could hope to master, and in turn as warpflesh bridged the gap between the halves of the ship and filled its holes with bone and spikes and cannons of hate and fire. Yet such was the will of the one who had brought it there, the now thoroughly possessed battle barge turned its anger upon those Imperials left in the system.<br/>
<br/>
He turned, and Magnus the Red rested his baleful eye upon the sole member of the audience who remained with him from the top of the Tower of the Cyclops before spitting in disgust at the whimpering creature he’d bound up. Only after that was done he turned back, and raised both of his arms as he unleashed his true power in tandem with the rest of his united Legion, as dozens of bound daemonships began to burn vast sigils into the very bedrock and mantle of the burning surface of Fenris. For a moment, his vast mind shifted if only to watch with careful suspicion over the remaining few ships left to the Imperials who had come here to burn away the Space Wolves but with satisfaction he observed as the last of the ships turned about and attempted to rush towards his worlds before being torn apart. Already The Rock had pulled back after he had personally teleported aboard the commanding vessels of the pathetic rabble called space marines in this realm and broken the rest of their forces.<br/>
<br/>
They knew nothing of what he planned to do here, only that they had failed and aided him in equal measure.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">====================<br/>​</div>Power burned in the warp and realspace alike. A hundred and more ships swarmed like locusts, some but a single vessel under the command of a Sorcerer, others as entire fleets and warbands that had been assembled by one of the Thousand Sons who had scattered across the galaxy. The lost sons of Prospero reunited under the hand of their Primarch, and now working together. Many of their number had fought, plotted, and killed their own blood before, but now under the one watchful gaze of the Crimson King, they forged the greatest of rituals. The burnt husk of Midgardia was of no concern, nor was the shattered orb that was once Frostheim. But the blazing Fenris, a world locked in ice but now sundered and scorched as Prospero in an age past, was of far greater interest.<br/>
<br/>
The Space Wolves could not bear the desecration, but neither could they stop it. Great Company after Great Company attempted to bring such to an end, accompanied by the Grey Knights and Dark Angels and all the others who had come to Fenris to destroy it by the lies of a daemon. And yet they simply could not match the combined might of the Thousand Sons, not with Magnus the Red standing with them all. All the while, the Planet of Sorcerers swept forward, utterly unaffected by the sickly demands of physics or reality or any other force in the universe save for Magnus himself.<br/>
<br/>
With sigils burnt into reality miles long, glorifying Chaos, beseeching Tzeentch, did Magnus laugh deeply as he drove Sortiarius directly into Fenris, daemonworld into world. But there was no titanic crash of the celestial spheres, for in truth the ritual had a far worse and much darker purpose. For did, to the eyes of the Space Wolves who were left to pathetically paw at the perimeter of a navy over a hundred strong in battleships, cruisers, and unknowable foreign designs of crystal and bone and pure light, was given the vision of a daemonworld consuming its lesser. It was not the destruction of Fenris that was sought in this, for that was but a simple matching of a crime committed long ago.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
<i>True</i> retribution demanded not only matching the crime dealt to them but <i>eclipsing it</i>.<br/>
<br/>
And so Sortiarius <i>devoured</i> Fenris, scoured largely clean of life but not entirely. The screams of its wolves, the howls of its mutate wulfen, were as the sweetest of wines to be drunk. The Space Wolves howled. They screamed. They beat their fists bloody against the walls of their ships and many demanded that action be taken despite the incredibly obvious futility. As great teeth of sapphire erupted as tall as mountains to pierce the vulnerable flesh of Fenris, they went to the Great Wolf, and they begged him to put aside the orders he’d given to remain. Some demanded it. Ragnar Blackmane attempted to duel him if only so that the Great Wolves could do <i>something</i> to stop this greatest of desecrations. But for all that the heart of the Great Wolf burned with grief and impotent fury, it was just that – impotent. There would be nothing served by charging in against such a force arrayed against them. He would not sacrifice the whole of their Chapter for such, despite every fiber of his being screaming for it.<br/>
<br/>
As Sortiarius completed its meal, the daemonworld shuddered, and yet still the Primarch went about his terrible work. His Legion formed themselves up in defensive formations, their slaves and servants manning their monstrous fleet just in case the will of the Space Wolves finally failed and let them run into certain death. Many expected it. Many more hoped for it. But it was not to be, and thus Sortiarius twisted itself inwards and outwards, a pure expression of the Lord of Change demonstrated in realspace as the world warped wildly until it <i>inverted</i>. The blazing hot core of its world was spun outwards in spindling trails of warp-corrupted molten metal miles long that whipped back and forth as an animal might, while the crust of Fenris and Sortiarius were seamlessly melded together into a dense center mass, from which those nine vast whips of twisting core-stuff became infected with and transformed completely by the powers of the Warp.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did the fleet of the Thousand Sons shift position, heading inwards, within the warm embrace of the daemonworld that was a mere planet no longer even in physical shape, Devourer of Worlds. Even as the Space Wolves, half of what remained of their Chapter, screamed defiance and charged out despite the orders of the Great Wolf in insane fury, many of them twisting into wulfen within their very vessels, did the warp shift again. The great warp rift that had been torn open and looked to threaten the entire Fenris System – such as it was now – disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
With it did go Sortiarius.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================<br/>​</div>“RRAAAAAAAAGGGGH!” Logan roared, picking up and slamming Azrael down to the ground again, hand around his throat. “Fenris! Gone! For your damned secrets, for your folly!”<br/>
<br/>
The Great Wolf threw the Supreme Grand Master against a wall hard enough to dent and tear, and yet none of the Dark Angels or other Chapters present dared do anything. The sheer hatred and anger which billowed forth from the rest of the Space Wolves, violence restrained by a threadbare strand of will, kept them all back. Even the Grey Knights and Inquisitorial representatives present found themselves stymied by the wolves as they quite openly held their weapons at the ready.<br/>
<br/>
“FOR A DAEMON’S LIES, FENRIS IS LOST TO A TRAITOR PRIMARCH!” Logan screamed again before throwing Azrael again, before slamming his boot into the chest of the Dark Angel and placing the edge of <i>Morkai</i> upon his throat hard enough to draw blood.<br/>
<br/>
“By all rights...the wolves should slaughter each and every ONE OF YOU!” he snarled, eyes looking up and piercing the Inquisitor and Grey Knights especially. “It was <i>your</i>,” he stabbed Morkai’s edge just that deeper into the battered throat of Azrael, “Bombardments, your <i>slaughters</i> that gave them their greatest of aid. You are traitors and fools, who have brought damnation not just upon Fenris but wherever next He strikes!”<br/>
<br/>
“Great Wolf,” Stern spoke, his step forward interrupted by the axe <i>Morkai</i> slamming into the deck plate before him.<br/>
<br/>
“DO NOT SPEAK!” Logan bellowed, the rest of the wolves around him growling in turn while Azrael struggled to his feet after being beaten down to them in the first place. “You…all of you…,” the Great Wolf trembled, his fists clenched at his sides, “GET OUT!”<br/>
<br/>
He then wrenched <i>Morkai</i> out of the deck, and slammed his chest into that of the Grey Knight, sending Stern stumbling back.<br/>
<br/>
“All of you. Dark Angels, Inquisition, Grey Knights,” Logan spat to the side, and the murder in his eyes in that moment was the clearest and most obvious thing anyone watching had ever seen. “All of you…LEAVE HERE AND NEVER RETURN! If <i>any</i> of you,” and here the Great Wolf turned to loom over the agents of the Inquisition, “<i>Any of you</i> are within this system within the next day, you will <i>die</i>!”<br/>
<br/>
And with that proclamation, did the Space Wolves eject the fourteen Chapters who had accompanied the Dark Angels to Fenris, the Inquisition, the Imperial Guard, the Navy, and all others who dared. In the next day after that, the whole of the entire Space Wolves Chapter, such as it now remained, transitioned into the warp, presumably to chase down the Planet of Sorcerers despite the near-certainty of failure and death.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">======================================​</div> <br/>
Screams and whimpers could be heard in the deepest and now most central chamber of the horrific living thing that was Sortiarius now. Magnus breathed deep, and listened for the screams as the last of the surviving inhabitants of Fenris were digested down to their very souls by the daemons of his world. He possessed no lungs, now, none that he did not desire to form from his body, but in this case, he felt it appropriate as he came to his most personal of projects. None of his Thousand Sons were allowed to come this deep into Sortiarius now, where the very Fang itself had been transformed and consumed for his own Tower which formed the very core. Even had all of them been working together, including Ahriman, could they have breached the defensive wards he had put in place here. As it should have been, as it needed to be.<br/>
<br/>
The doors melted away, allowing him to breath deep of the smell of exposed rotting meat and blood both fresh and old.<br/>
<br/>
“I have devoured Fenris with my own, now,” he said conversationally, though he knew that the one within possessed no ears or eardrums to hear him at the moment. “It is <i>gone</i>, and now its very <i>core</i> forms the body and defenses of my world.”<br/>
<br/>
With each step, he the volume of blood upon the floor rose, and yet he reveled in it. Tools were summoned to his hands, chips and pieces of the very <i>thing</i> that had crafted him and all his brother twisted and purified by Chaos.  All around him, the skinned faces of those who had suffered similar faces had been melded with the walls themselves to scream eternally in rictus and pain with their souls slowly digested by his very being, by his tower which was bound to and by him. But none of them had lasted nearly so long. None could possibly have done so either, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Shackled in thick cord made of his own skinned hide, musculature openly weeping blood upon the floor as flesh struggled to grow again once more, did his prisoner shudder and shy away from his presence. For there was no light in this place save what emanated from Magnus himself, and yet it was known that such a light promised no salvation. It never would, for such was denied to Magnus just as well. The daemon prince stepped closer, and with one hand roughly grasped the skinless chin and bone of the skull of his prisoner, and tilted the head back and forth. Then he ripped the fat and musculature away to reveal the thousands and thousands of sigils that he had carved into the very bone itself over the course of all the time he’d held him. Each, of pain, fear, horror, of Tzeentch, of Chaos, repeated over and over in a literally endless set.<br/>
<br/>
It took a casual application of his powers to enhance his strength enough to rip the jawbone open, crushing it beneath forefinger and thumb, to examine the marrow beneath. Or, perhaps more importantly, the sigils that had been carved on the inner hollow of the bones themselves to craft a Mobius strip, an endless and forever shifting field of runes that glittered each with enough power to crush a simple mortal mind with their potency.<br/>
<br/>
“Gn….gnnn…gnn…,” the prisoner struggled to say with blood welling within his throat and out of his mouth, eyes torn out again and again.<br/>
<br/>
‘Go away Magnus, can’t you see I’m trying to sleep?’ had been the mocking call, the first time. Then the second. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth. On and on had come a seemingly endless well of defiance.<br/>
<br/>
But he had the time to break him. All the time in the world, for the flows of such were his to command when in the warp.<br/>
<br/>
“With Fenris gone, the Space Wolves decimated, no way for them to find recruits, they are <i>doomed</i>. Just. Like. You.”<br/>
<br/>
Leman Russ, spine barely healed after the last session, looked up at him with one eye, the other having been ripped out for the tenth time already, and calmly spat blood into Magnus’ face.<br/>
<br/>
“RRAGGGH!” a moment of inhuman fury passed through the Crimson King in that instant, and he reached forward so that he could rip the skeleton out further, shredding and stabbing and killing not with any weapon or tool which he dropped to his sides but with his bare hands.<br/>
<br/>
It was not a slow death.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Magnus found himself shredding and beating upon nothing more than broken meat and chips of bone. All at once the emotions mostly drained out of him, a cool frustration replacing everything else. A sweep of his hand, and the whole of it was dumped out into the chambers below to be feasted upon by daemons and darker things, teleported through the warp with incredible ease. All except, of course, for the face, where despite its skin retained the shape and appearance of Leman Russ’ defiance even in death. Magnus lifted up that scarlet dripping chunk of meat and then slammed it to the wall, where it melded with it night instantly, where it would join the others.<br/>
<br/>
Then he exited, his whole frame washed clean with a miniscule amount of will, and teleported himself elsewhere within the hollowed sphere of daemonflesh, crystal, and rock that was Sortiarius itself. A cabal of his sons was there, and they bowed before his presence as he approached.<br/>
<br/>
“Find me Fabius Bile. The latest of his clones has expired…<i>again</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
None of them were right. They did not <i>break</i> like they should. They did not break like they were <i>supposed </i>to. But he would find a way. He would exercise his tortures and his hate and his powers again and again until he perfected the method and then when he did find his prey again he would shatter the infernal spirit of Leman Russ for true and not just upon a clone. After the Wolf King had escaped him the first time, he had despaired that he could be located again. But he had. But before he could break him, he had somehow escaped again. There were only so many more times that the grasp of Magnus the Red could be avoided and slipped out from under. Yet thus far every time, every torture, had done nothing to properly shatter his mind and soul…<br/>
<br/>
Magnus then pulled, and from nowhere did he bring forth a knotted fetish of bloodied and still dripping flesh as he returned to his tower, to the mutated structure that was once the Fang and sat upon a throne that Russ himself had once been seated atop.<br/>
<br/>
“I shall find him again,” he hissed as he lifted it high, “From the very flesh I stripped from his hide the first time, I shall <i>find him again!”</i><br/>
<br/>
And from massive gulf of darkness within the spaces between stars, the hellish glow of a daemonworld grew brighter as the Thousand Sons set to their monstrous work, the undulating and never-cooling tentacles of Fenris’ core metals whipping endlessly back and forth all the while. And the massive beacon of blackened yet scorching psychic light bloomed further in the minds of those who dared to gaze in its direction, drawing the curious and greedy attentions of chittering hordes without number. From within the Octarius Sector, between points that orks did not have the attention spans to look for or equipment or of mind to see, did that beacon burst with power. For there were worse shields that one could have while they went about their vile work than an entire orkish empire.</div>
