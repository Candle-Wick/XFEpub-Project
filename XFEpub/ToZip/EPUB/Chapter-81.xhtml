    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: Scouting Karag Lhune, Part 4</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Head upwards to the Hall of the Moon, to scout the defences of the Crooked Moon Tribe.



You're here primarily to scout out the enemy, and the Hall of the Moon is where you'd expect to find the largest concentration of the enemy, so you backtrack until you reach a stairwell you passed earlier and begin your ascent. In contrast with the giant shaft-and-staircase that the secondary peak sported, this staircase is relatively narrow and seems designed for pedestrian traffic rather than military throughput. This set of stairs is far from the Chiselwards and the Hall of Oaths, and the relatively untouched nature of the stairs suggests that they're rarely used by the current inhabitants, with only the occasional patch of neglected phosphorescent fungi breaking up the darkness. If the stairs weren't as regular and even as you'd come to expect from Dwarven manufacture, you'd be risking your ankles as you clambered upwards in the dark, and as is you almost end up slipping on a trickle of foul-smelling water, which emerges from one crack in the wall to disappear into another, two flights down.

You're glad you've been counting flights of stairs, because you've no other way of estimating how far you'd climbed - your bitterly complaining legs suggest that you should be halfway to Mannslieb by now, but the count suggests you're only just approaching the correct level. And at long last, the pattern of stairs and smooth walls is broken by an opening into much wider tunnels, and you can already hear, far off in the distance, the squabbling chatter of relaxing Goblins. You take a moment to shroud yourself in Ulgu and then begin your approach, more cautious as you enter into the more populated tunnels. The stone underfoot becomes soft, near completely covered with vast growths of greenskin lichen, apparently deliberately cultivated as the Goblin equivalent of roads, and with your footsteps muffled slipping past the few Goblins lounging about the halls as 'guards' is trivial, and you slip through a side door and quickly clamber up some nearby scaffolding to find both shadow to conceal you from the vast bonfires that illuminate the hall, and a vantage point to survey the enormous cavern you now find yourself in, occasionally ducking out of sight as one of the thousands of Night Goblins present gets too close.

[Sneaking: Intrigue 38+17+20(Magically hidden)=75.]
[Spotting: 45]

The hall itself shows no indication of what purpose it held in the ancient Karak. The walls bear layer after layer of gouges, and the sheer thoroughness of the vandalism is remarkable - not a single patch of the original walls remain. Far above, gaping pockmarks show the absence of the long-lost decorations that once showed a beautiful facsimile of the night sky. All that remains now is the giant orb representing the moon, painstakingly desecrated to turn it into an enormous effigy of the Crooked Moon Tribe's grinning banner. But worst of all is the floor which caved in centuries or millennia ago, which is now ringed with jagged teeth of stone to dissuade any of its inhabitants from trying to escape. Trapped within the pit are hundreds upon hundreds of orcs, some howling threats and orders up at the Night Goblins who jeer back down at them, but most slumped down, either too resigned, too injured, or too drugged to resist. Most that you can see bear markings that identify them as Broken Toof, the tribe that had held the East Gates, and you wonder if these were picked off from the greenskins that routed or whether the Crooked Moon have been preying on the Broken Toof since before the Expedition arrived.

Every scrap of floor that hasn't caved in is covered with crude greenskin hovels, which grow upwards like fungi to cling to any part of the walls not too badly gouged to support their weight. Side passages, both carved by Dwarven tools and chipped away by Goblin picks, radiate out from the hall like cracks from an impact crater, leading in every direction and constantly being ducked into and out of by scurrying Goblins. All you can see are Night Goblins, the subterranean variety of the creatures with an affinity for darkness and fungus, though only a few wear the cloaks that you associate with them, being safe here from the light of the surface world.

Greenskins are incredibly simple creatures in many ways, and when you start to look for whoever would be in charge here, you need look no further than the platform that would give the best vantage point for hurling abuse and projectiles upon the slaves below. Upon it are two creatures, equally hideous but in very different ways. On one side, the apparent leader of the Night Goblins capers and cackles, his distended form so rippling with muscle that he seems more like a squat orc than a Goblin. His mad grin reveals gums embedded with shards of glowing warpstone where teeth should be, and every movement produces clanging from the layers of mismatched metal plates covering his torso. On the other, equally oversized but with bloated fat rather than muscle is a hideous, balding rat-man, deep in discussion with the Goblin. Every so often he gestures with his whip, and green energy crackles along its metal links as it moves.

As the mismatched pair chatter away like two housewives at a market, you take in the creatures that appear to be accompanying the Skaven. A score of heavily-armoured man-size rats grip halberds and eye the chattering Night Goblins with caution, and hovering near them, transfixed by their equal fear of the warrior-rats and the surrounding Goblins, are much smaller Skaven clothed in rags and scars. With every crackle of their master's whip they flinch towards a pair of crude wagons, then settle down when they see that the negotiations continue. The wagons are piled high with dog-sized cages, and through the bars you can see the silhouettes of rats - actual rats rather than the half-man, half-rat abominations, but grown to hideous size and with a row of wicked-looking bone spikes along their spines.

As you scan the room, you can see a similar amount of cages stacked haphazardly nearby, all empty.


[ ] Attempt to assassinate the Night Goblin leader...
-[ ] Immediately.
-[ ] After the Skaven leave.
[ ] Attempt to assassinate the Skaven leader...
-[ ] Immediately.
-[ ] After they leave, and you have trailed them a safe distance from the Hall.
[ ] Attempt to interfere with the Hall of the Moon...
-[ ] By freeing the Orc prisoners.
-[ ] By freeing the wagonload of giant rats.

[ ] Trail the Skaven leader after he leaves, to find where he calls home.

[ ] You've scouted this area, now...
-[ ] To the Armoury, to check if the ancient weapons remain sealed away.
-[ ] To the Temple of Grungni, to check if the holy place remains undesecrated.
-[ ] To the Chiselwards, an enormous warren of tunnels that could house any number of horrors.
-[ ] To the King's Gates, to scout the outer defences.
-[ ] To the depths of Karag Lhune, to see how far the Crooked Moon Tribe's influence reaches.

[ ] You've finished scouting, you'll return to the Vanguard...
-[ ] By slipping out the King's Gates.
-[ ] By waiting just inside the King's Gates.
-[ ] By returning to the secondary peak.

[ ] Other (write in)


- If you manage to escape and evade pursuit immediately after interfering or assassinating, it would not cost you any time. If.
- You have time to scout two more places and meet the Vanguard at or inside the gates, or one more place and escape via the secondary peak.
- If you attempt to trail the Skaven home, you would almost certainly miss the arrival of the Vanguard.
- To your Magesight, the Night Goblin leader is at the center of a cloud of warpstone radiation which makes it impossible to tell if he is a shaman. The Skaven leader is not magical.
