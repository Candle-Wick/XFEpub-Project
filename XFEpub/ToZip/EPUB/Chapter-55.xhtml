“HORUS! AARGGGGGGGH!!” the space marine screamed as they died, flailing and firing in all directions as the Black Rage consumed them from within.<br/>
<br/>
A hundred and one bolters fired upon them, and tore the screaming lost astartes into little more than wet chunks as even the ceramite of their armor failed under sheer volume of bolter rounds. Yet more of them screamed into the fray, sigils of the Emperor and the Imperium scoured and covered unintentionally beneath the innocent blood that they had spilled that day. In the burning wreckage of the city, once of a Civilized World twice ravaged over by both orks and protectors alike, more of the marines alternatively attacked each other, those few screaming survivors, and those that had come to kill them from the stars themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The response, of course, was not wholly that of ranged weaponry. Hundreds more charged forward, their own bellowed war cries booming through the air as they leapt forward bearing their own swords and axes that either blazed with power fields or churned with growling bits with which to flense the foe. Many died as they fought against space marines so consumed with the ultimate of fury that few space marines could ever truly match that would suffer a hundred mortal wounds before finally dying. More than one eager marine who had charged forward against the advice of their superiors in a massive pack realized their folly as their own arms were ripped off and they found themselves beaten to death with them.<br/>
<br/>
Skulls crunched, spines snapped, and throughout it all marines died not just on the nameless planet far beyond the Emperor’s gaze and that of the Imperium, but in the orbit above the world where ships nearly slammed together from the boarding actions and sheer knife-edge combat. Transhuman fought against transhuman, and rivers of blood were spilt enough in volume that pleased even the laughing Dark Gods who watched with amusement as brother slew brother once more. It was, in fact, almost as if the Horus Heresy had come again albeit to a world that had not been touched by that ancient fiery conflict.<br/>
<br/>
“I’LL KILL YOU HORUS! KILL YOU!” a armless and legless marine died, dragging themselves forward by the chin and neck before finally being stomped to death.<br/>
<br/>
All around, the Black Rage burned, wildly, wholly out of control. Even the best of them, their Captains, had fallen into it. For so long, so many years, they had thought to conquer it somehow only to be denied. If anything, the recent conflict and fighting at Baal had reawakened an even greater blaze of self-conflagration. They had sought to only serve the Emperor further, of course, until they could no longer. Some had entertained the thought of a blaze of glory wherein they brought the whole of the Tau Empire and their very race into extinction. But it was not to be. They would not survive the journey, nor the length of the war that would follow. Thus they had chased an orkish WAAAGH!! beyond the borders of the Imperium itself, where they could die with glory but without their final horrifying dooms coming upon them and being revealed to any who would observe it. Let others find them in death, rather than watch as they died.<br/>
<br/>
But their wishes had not been answered, for the universe was a harsh and a cruel place.<br/>
<br/>
Upon a hill where not but hours before their Chapter Master had slain the Warboss not in a glorious duel but in a fit of savagery and shameful animalistic screaming when the Black Rage consumed him, that same now maddened hulking figure stood drenched in the blood of ally, xeno, and foe alike. Over two dozen corpses of those that had come after their slowly maddening chapter lay about its feet as it continually ripped and teared at the corpses with even the teeth, the feral beast that had once been a noble space marine gone utterly with the rage of Sanguinius in him. If anything, of course, the Black Rage had only increased the sheer deadliness of the Chapter Master, for what he had lost in his conscious mind the unbridled rage of his Primarch flowing through him had granted him speed and strength that would have otherwise been undreamed of. And yet more marines came on, with weapons aplenty to bring him down.<br/>
<br/>
Flamers, grenades, bolters, sniper rifles, shotguns, plasma weaponry, and more than a few power weapons were all brought forth against the son of Sanguinius, and against them all did the Chapter Master stand. Twin chainswords guttered and died as the blood and viscera drowned them to the point that not even their growling teeth could function any longer. This provided no comfort to those who were soon beaten to death by the now stilled hunks of metal. Screaming, endlessly screaming, the Chapter Master demanded that Horus face him, that he saw Horus everywhere was not the issue, only that each and every flickering and laughing image of the betrayer be slain with the utmost violence.<br/>
<br/>
A dozen more died, and yet they were but a distraction, for then cutting through armor and flesh and bone and life, came a mighty axe which split the Chapter Master in twain. Not even the Black Rage could push a corpse so completely delivered unto death further, and so in an abrupt instant the Chapter Master was stilled. All around the hill, throughout the burning city, the last of those lost sons of Sanguinius died, the Black Rage having finally achieved its final victory and driven the last of them to their deaths.<br/>
<br/>
On top of the hill, breathing heavily after having cut through a near Company of tragically implanted scouts and neophytes brought to their end not by a true enemy of the Imperium but of their own tainted gene-seed, Logan Grimnar growled before wrenching the axe Morkai from the back of his slain target. Pausing only to heft it better in his grip, he surveyed the burnt and burning land all around him as the rest of the Rout present slowly assembled before him, old and new. So many newer faces than old, of course, and for that he grieved, but it was a grief subsumed beneath a blazing fury which he could note was near all-consuming as the very Black Rage he had just witnessed in its entirety, save that he retained his mind through it. Perhaps that was a curse in and of itself, perhaps it was a blessing.<br/>
<br/>
He did not know, and did not care to expend the effort upon such frivolous philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
“Engir,” he growled into his communicator, gaze already turning to the skies above. “Report.”<br/>
<br/>
“That is the last of the wretches,” one of the last of the old Wolf Lords snarled back in turn, the sound of killing still audible through the vox. “The Knights of Blood are <i>done</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
“Their ships?”<br/>
<br/>
The whole reason the Rout had come, that most concerning of things after what had been done to them…?<br/>
<br/>
“We have taken their two battle barges, and six of their nine strike cruisers intact.”<br/>
<br/>
Logan grit his teeth, the grinding of the enamel loud enough for Engir to hear.<br/>
<br/>
“Only six?”<br/>
<br/>
“They fought hard, in the end, as the Black Rage consumed them,” was Engir's only response before he cut the connection.<br/>
<br/>
It was brazen, to disrespect the Great Wolf in such a manner. But not entirely unexpected. The very unity of the Chapter was even now a shaky thing, and many of his oldest comrades had become sullen shadows of themselves. But what could he do, when Logan knew that the same could be said of him?<br/>
<br/>
“This is what we have been reduced to, Magnus,” he growled at the stars, “Is this what you wanted? To see the sons of Russ scrounge and scavenge like animals?”<br/>
<br/>
There was no answer, of course.<br/>
<br/>
“Then we <i>will</i>,” he continued, “Behold, our newest wolves, <i>of Fenris</i>, despite your best efforts,” he gestured at some of those very space wolves, all Blood Claws by age but forced into experience and tempered by the sheer incredible violence of a Chapter consumed by the Black Rage.<br/>
<br/>
They were, all of them, so very young and untested. Unnatural, many of the handful of Wolf Lords proclaimed, but even the bitterest amongst them could not deny that they were needed. If anything, this entire excursion had showed that they possessed <i>something</i> of their lost world. It did not make the fact that their very bones still glimmered with the runes engraved on them when exposed less disquieting. The fact that despite the best efforts of those with the ability at randomizing their gestations as much as could be allowed that many of them looked like they could be twins, or triplets, or more. That they came from the Wolf Wombs, as some insolent Blood Claw had named them, all. Indoctrinated, of course, with the greatest of rituals that the Rune Priests could perform. Even now, none of them were on this battlefield, forced to remain in the ships above for detecting the slightest hint of Chaotic mutation and taint within what those who thought he did not hear called blasphemy.<br/>
<br/>
“We will scrounge, and scrape, and scavenge,” Logan glared at the cold stars above, as if he could see the bastard daemon somehow, “And we will <i>come</i> for you! The Rout is not dead <i>yet</i>!”<br/>
<br/>
It would come.<br/>
<br/>
The Rout would come.<br/>
<br/>
But not yet. Not until it was ready.</div>
