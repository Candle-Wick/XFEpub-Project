Though it's largely made redundant by your visit there and hearing about it in person from Roswita, you still go through the information the EIC collected from gossip and and observable movements from the front line. The Army of Stirland is holding and fortifying Tempelhof, Pfaffbach and Regrakhof, while the 3rd Division is on the long march around Hunger Wood to Siegfriedhof to reinforce the Black Guard and be in position for what promises to be a brutal war against the Strigoi that call it home. But though the casualty lists promise to be brutal, they're guaranteed to be less than if any of the Vampires established themselves enough to start turning their gaze towards the Empire, even without considering the disaster that Teufelheim could have ended up being. That was the reasoning that Abelhelm used to begin the Purge six years ago, and one thing you share with Roswita is a firm belief that it still applies.

Today's Council Meeting is once more done on the move, this time in Karagril, and the seven of you gather to inspect the defences at the base of the mountain. A corridor twenty could march abreast down stretches a hundred meters or so before it opens into the Grand Avenue, which is now the territory of Clan Mors. None present trust in Clan Mors' many enemies to keep them from striking if they're shown a weak point, so Prince Gotri and his underlings have been busy amplifying the underground defences, which previously were limited to man-portable weapons and the one-Dwarf ballistae of Karak Norn, and the latest addition seems to basically be a mortar pointed down the tunnel, mounted on a stone pedestal braced with steel.

"I took some inspiration from our Imperial allies," and Gotri gives a bow in your direction. "Their 'mortars' don't have a long barrel because they don't need one - they don't want maximum force like you do with a cannon, they want an exactly-measured amount of force to give the parabolic arc they want. Similarly, we don't need maximum velocity here. We'd be up against personal armour and flesh, and maximum range is about 150 meters. We also lose out on accuracy from both velocity and rifling, but if we're not shooting single balls..." He pulls a bundle of metal balls wrapped in flimsy-looking rope from the nearest gun. "We don't need it. We're killing in an expanding cone instead of a straight line. So it takes less steel, less precision, and less work to make, and since it's bolted down we can overengineer instead of trying to make it battlefield portable so it's as reliable as any cannon rolling out of Zhufbar. Instead of a typical swabbing, it's right at head height and short enough to look into. One Dwarf sees to the touch-hole, one does a visual inspection of the barrel for sparks or flame or debris. Wrapped powder in, shot in," he replaces the shot, "punch it," he does so and winces, "the loaders use a padded glove - and fire. Four shots a minute easy, and we're working on designs for powder and shot that I think can get it up to six." Everyone present, both Council and those on guard, cover their ears as Gotri holds the linstock to the touch-hole, and with a mighty roar metal projectiles are sent flying down the corridor in an expanding cloud.

"How many?" King Belegar asks.

"Five at each underground front, twenty total. We're on track to triple that in another six months, and all the work is being done at Karak Azul so that's alongside any other work."

"Fifteen of these, ten bolt throwers... could they be moved?"

"Not tactically, but if you're in no hurry, sure."

"Good. Keep on it."

The Temple of Grungni is not to be visited by layfolk while it's in the process of being excavated, as to Grungni the process of mining out the Temple is as sacred as the Temple itself. But as you walk past it on the way upwards, Gunnars explains that it's on track for completion in another year or so. He'd not been able to draw in any high-ranking members of the established Temples, but a Temple focused on Grungni's aspect of Mining has attracted enough interest from mining clans to fill out a priesthood. You also pass through the residential area being rebuilt, which isn't at all necessary considering most of the Chiselwards remained empty, but the Norgrimlings and Ironbacks apparently preferred architecture that followed the crooked trail of an extinguished seam over the strict order of usual Dwarven architecture.

The next stop is one of the many stone platforms that jut out from the northern face of Karagril, giving a dominating view of Death Pass. There's a half-dozen of the Undumgi on guard, four relaxing in the small room below who scramble to their feet and stand to attention at their unexpected visitors, and two on guard up top, watching the Pass below. And finally, the reason for their presence tucked into a small recess in the face of Karagril, a greatcannon fresh from the foundries of Nuln. "They said the Emperor has first refusal and the Elector Count of Wissenland has second, but as long as they could boast of supplying cannon to Karak Eight Peaks, the rest of their production is ours," Prince Kazrik says, unable to keep from smiling with pride. "And I had an unofficial word with the Emperor's representative in Nuln, and now we possess a license to buy cannon at Nuln rates, rather than paying the foreign powers and private citizen cannon tariffs."

"Excellent work. How many have we got?"

"Thirty now, ten more en route. If I remain there to beat the Elector Counts to any that come out of the foundry, I think I can get to at least sixty by the end of the year."

"Good. Head back and stay on it, and see if you can get your hands on some of their mortars, too. Speaking of the Empire, Princess Edda?"

"I was able to find a significant number of interested weavers in," she checks her notes, "Wissenland, Averland, and Stirland. Final headcount will have to wait until we see how many actually show up to the Black Fire Pass ferries I organized, but I'm expecting at least three hundred, largely thanks to Master Weber's contacts in the Empire. I was also able to recruit a group of human engineers from the University of Nuln, who were unable to find any interest in the Empire for their loom designs."

"Excellent. See to getting them established-"

"Excuse me, my King," Princess Edda interrupts, "but I've discovered that I have no affinity for dealing with or managing humans. I believe it would be better for the economy of your Karak for a new Steward to be found." She's obviously rehearsed saying this, and to her credit none of her nervousness is visible except in a tremble in her shoulders.

King Belegar considers her for some time. "No," he says finally. "You've shown diligence and ability in every other aspect of the role, and there's no shame in not being equally skilled in every new and strange challenge Karak Eight Peaks supplies. Give the leader of the Undumgi temporary control of Karag Nar and let him know if he proves equal to the task, it will be made permanent and he will be given the title of Thane. Drop management of the silk business in his lap, that can be his trial. Meanwhile, see to establishing proper infrastructure in Karagril - they've got picks and the like, but they'll need a blacksmith for sharpening and repairs, a carpenter for support beams, and a smelter until we retake Karag Rhyn. Probably several other things, too - find out what."

"Thank you, King Belegar," Princess Edda says, just above a whisper.

"No thanks needed. Since you were given it, you've earned your position and you'll do so several more times over in the coming years."

The Silver Tower remains in ruins, but it still supplies an amazing view of the entire Karak and from there Dreng gives the results of the hard work of the scouts. "Kvinn-Wyr," he says, pointing to the most distant. "Trolls, as we know. The Sentinels show signs of Orc habitation at some point, but they're long gone." He skips over Mhonar to point at Karag Rhyn. "Broken Toof above, Crooked Moon below. The former used to live in the caldera and the latter once had the entire mountain, so they're crammed in and angry at each other about it, though right now it's skirmishes instead of all-out war. Which is strange, because Karag Mhonar is right there and, as far as I could tell, uninhabited. Lots of dead greenskins and Skaven, from fresh to ancient, all with shattered bones. But my Rangers have scoured it from top to bottom and found nothing."

"Strange," King Belegar says. "Have the greenskins fortified against the east?"

"Not a bit. They just don't venture into the tunnels that link the two Karags."

"Any trolls ventured west?"

"None, as far as I can tell. Not even corpses."

"Damn strange. Yar?"

"Eshin, top and bottom."

"Not just a warband, then. Blast."

"As for Zilfin..." All eyes go to the tallest of the eight peaks, the only one apart from Karagril to stretch so high as to have snow on its peak year-round. "Skryre underneath, but though they've fortified the caldera entrance and the Grim Gates above, that's as high as they've gone. Should have noticed why sooner. Look."

He points upward at Karagril's peak, and then back at Zilfin. You can't see anything significant about either, but Prince Gotri's eyes narrow as he peers back and forth between them. "The frost line's higher on Karagril."

"Ice Dragon," Dreng confirms.

King Belegar sighs. "That's the last thing we need. Grim tidings, but fine work, Dreng. Head to Karak Azul, have a word with their Blacksmiths Guild. We've been getting a trickle of individual Dwarves and some entire Clans, and not all have ancestral weapons. Make sure there's at least an axe and a shield for each, and have the sigil of Eight Peaks on each." He smiles and nods. "Finally, surface defence. Master Weber?"

All eyes turn to Karag Nar, and the two tower on its peak. "With assistance from Kragg, Gunnars, and the Grey College, it's operational, but I believe there's still more to be done before it could be considered complete."

He nods. "Will it remain as operational as it is now?"

You consider the possible upgrades you have in mind. "Yes."

"Then by all means."

Personal Actions: you have four actions you can apply without engaging in overwork.
Current overwork status: [+] [  ] [  ]
Each box will be filled by one action of overwork, and will take the two turns after that to fade as you recover. The first box incurs no penalty. The second will give a -10 penalty to all actions during the first turn of recovery. The third will  give a -20 penalty to all actions on both turns of recovery. 
Overwork incurs no penalties on the turns taken, only on the turns recovering from it. You can take as many actions of overwork as you have unfilled boxes.
When you use overwork it fills the left-most empty box, so [-][ ][ ] becomes [-][+][ ], not [+][-][ ]. All boxes recover in parallel and independent from one another, but second and third apply maluses on your actions during that cooldown period.

- The EIC information-gathering results will now be part of these results & reports phases, though if information would be applicable to the events of the turn it will be used there even though it isn't delivered 'on-screen' until now.
- There is a four hour voting moratorium.
- As always, if there's something I've missed, let me know.
- I've formalized the fading of memory with the paper topics rules.
- I've added a bunch of information to the Dramatis Personae page, specifying various K8P stats under each of the councillors.
- Information Mathilde would know: frost dragons are the 'normal' dragons with pale blue scales and freezing breath. Ice dragons are the name for Emperor Dragons of that sub-type, the largest, oldest, wisest, and most powerful of dragons, who are often spellcasters as well. Ice Dragons that cast magic use Hysh, the Lore of Light.
