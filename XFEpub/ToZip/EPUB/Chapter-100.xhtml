    <h2>Karak Eight Peaks: Expeditionary Epilogue 4</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Stay single. Marry for love.
[*] Court Wizard



Anton is a sweetheart. You think you could be happy with him, and even if you weren't you'd be sure you'd be at least content. But while you might be willing to settle for that, he shouldn't be. He's a genuinely kind person in a thoroughly unkind world, and while normally that type of person inevitably ends up shattered by said world, Anton has proven time and time again that there's something about him - perhaps his likeability, perhaps his genuineness, perhaps some hidden streak of genius - that has made him able to enforce his will upon the world. The memory you keep coming back to is the Siege of Castle Drakenhof, where Asarnil atop his dragon had obliterated the Cairn Wraiths and tore every fleeing Vargheist from the sky to fall broken onto the trees below. That is the sort of accomplishment Anton is somehow capable of. So when you do arrive back in Blutdorf, the answer to him is simple: ignore the harpies. Marry for love.

"Easier said than done," he sighs, but you instantly shake your head.

"Saying would be doing." You look over at the man standing just outside the door. "What's his name?"

Anton barely glances over. "Ermanrich."

"Ermanrich!" The man turns and peers into the room. Part of nobility is never having privacy, but good guards would pretend to be deaf until they were called upon. "If Anton told you to throw me out, would you?"

He looks at you doubtfully. "I would try."

"There you go. If these petty noble girls try to badger you, have them ejected. Doubt they'd put up more of a fight than I could. Might cause a political fuss, but less so than the headache they'd be if they succeeded."

You spend the next few days lingering in Blutdorf and trying to build up Anton's self-confidence in his ability to control his fate, and by the time you leave he's at least willing to give it his best. Unfortunately, that's all you have time for - the year is coming to a close and by Nachexen, King Belegar wants his council to be ready to begin work. You've decided to accept the position of Court Wizard, beating out the more traditional option of a Court Runesmith or a Master Engineer, but deciding what that means is almost entirely your own decision.

First, there are the Journeymanlings. Esbern and Seija will be remaining at least until the spiders are sorted out, and it would be much easier to convince them to stay, and the Amber College to back your request, as a Court Wizard than it would have been as 'Head Ranger' or 'Marshal of the Undumgi'. Panoramia has fairly deep ties to the Halflings already and is likely to be making herself useful with them for years or longer. Maximilian will be learning as much as he can from his new friend in Clan Angrund, and considering his appreciation for Dwarven artifice, he's likely to stick around even after his studies conclude. Johann's deception could give you an in to bring him under your authority, even though he's your equal and may have seniority over you.

On the other hand, time spent managing junior wizards would be time not spent pursuing your own tasks and goals.

Which of the Journeymanlings to recruit will be in plan format. Votes for individual Wizards will be considered votes to only hire that Wizard. This is because it would be optimal to have two or four without the trait, or three with it - unless you plan to hire more later.

[ ] Recruit Esbern and Seija
[ ] Recruit Panoramia
[ ] Recruit Maximilian
[ ] Recruit Johann

There's also the matter of the EIC. While it is certainly thriving under WIlhelmina's rule, it's worrying how much of Stirland's economy it has been allowed to control.

[ ] Take an active hand in the EIC
One action per turn will be spent keeping in touch with the EIC, allowing you to more directly control it and, if you wish, helping it branch out towards Karak Eight Peaks.
[ ] Leave the EIC alone
Wilhelmina's the least bad person to fill the power vacuum Roswita has left in Western Stirland.
[ ] Interfere with the EIC
As Wilhelmina herself pointed out, you own enough of it that you could easily dominate the EIC. Start bringing it down.

The long journey back to Karak Eight Peaks also gives you a lot of time to ruminate over the Expedition. Despite not even lasting six months, it was certainly eventful and you've learned a great deal.

Mathilde has gained +1 Martial, +2 Intrigue, +3 Piety. You can also choose new traits or change existing ones. For Changed Traits, the stat bonus is on top of the existing bonus. The two with the most votes will win. You can have two new traits or two replaced traits or one of each. 

New Trait:
[ ] Infiltrator: Nobody seems to guard anything well enough to keep you out. +2 Intrigue, +10 bonus to infiltration.
[ ] Scout: Sometimes the best weapon is knowing where everything is. +2 Intrigue, +20 to infiltrating all but the highest-security areas.
[ ] Assassin: Combat is easiest when the other person doesn't realize they're in it. +2 Intrigue, +40 bonus against unaware targets.
[ ] Avatar: You're growing worryingly familiar with being used as a conduit by deities. ???
[ ] Polyglot: Your time with the Dwarves has revealed that you have an ear for languages, and learn new languages much faster.
[ ] Marksman: Blackpowder is a wonderful thing. +2 Martial, +10 to attacks with blackpowder weapons.
[ ] Collegiate: They say managing Wizards is like herding cats. Herding cats isn't actually that difficult. Can manage three other wizards per action spent.
[ ] Magical Duellist: Anyone unwise enough to try to cast spells you don't want them to will quickly regret it. +2 Learning, +10 bonus to dispelling and inducing miscasts.

Changed Traits:
[ ] Wolf Familiar > Winter Wolf Familiar: Turns out Wolf is a late bloomer. Wolf will grow large enough to ride upon.
[ ] Brave > Daredevil: Runic protection, magical protection, magical healing... why are people scared of combat again? +2 Martial, immune to fear/terror effects.
[ ] Blooded > Campaigner: You've seen more than your share of battles. +2 Martial, +10 bonus to fighting alongside others.
[ ] Bureaucrat + Practical > Warrior of Paperwork: Scholarship is just a specific form of paperwork. You can live with it. Combines the two traits, +2 Learning, remove penalty to writing papers yourself.
[ ] Practical > Collaborator: Though you still prefer fieldwork to paperwork, you've found that as long as someone else is doing the actual writing, you're capable of producing some amazing papers. +2 Learning, +20 bonus to dictating papers.
[ ] Practical > Hands On: Wait, you can just get other people to do the paperwork? Why didn't I think of this sooner? +1 Diplomacy, +1 Stewardship, +1 Martial, +1 Intrigue, -1 Learning, +10 bonus to insights developed 'in the field' (as opposed to careful laboratory study). 
[ ] Windreader > Windsage: Your magical senses see more than your normal ones. +2 Learning, even more able to see and understand emotion and magical effects in others.
[ ] Disdain for Sigmar > Polytheist: Your bitterness towards Sigmar has softened with time and distance. You're still not thrilled with him, but as long as his followers are coexisting with those of other Gods, you can deal with it. +1 Piety, removes anti-Sigmarite penalty except when dealing with Sigmarite supremacists and monotheists.


And finally, the least troubling matter to consider: your Torc of Fire. A nice gift when you first received it, but ever since you learned a spell that outstrips its ability to intimidate your enemies, it's seemed rather surplus to requirements.

[ ] Return it with your thanks to the Bright College. +2 College Favour.
[ ] Try to sell it as you pass through Barak Varr. +??gc
[ ] Donate it to whoever ends up leading the Undumgi.
[ ] Donate it to the Winter Wolves of Ulrikadrin.
[ ] Keep it around in case you ever want to study non-Ulgu enchantments.
[ ] Keep it anyway - you might need to encourage allies at some point.


- You will have the option to spend actions helping Anton with his love life in coming turns.
- Without any relevant traits, each Wizard under your authority will soak up half an action a turn to manage. Esbern and Seija together count as one. Other Wizards may also investigate K8P of their own accord, and you will be able to take on Apprentices, recruit Journeymen, lure Magisters and hire Perpetual Apprentices from the Colleges in future turns if you so wish.
- Which of the Journeymanlings to recruit will be in plan format. Votes for individual Wizards will be considered votes to only hire that Wizard. This is because it would be optimal to have two or four without the trait, or three with it - unless you plan to hire more later.
- If there are other traits you think should be possible, let me know and I'll consider adding them to the options.
- The next turn should be the first turn as a councillor of K8P and the beginning of 2479, and at some point between now and then I'll work on a 'state of the Karak' threadmark to total current population and military forces.
- Happy 100th update. Thank you all for joining me on this journey.
