<br/>
The cultist died screaming that same line, repeated a hundred fold by his fellow damned. Men, women, children and elders, they all advanced in their filth-ridden robes with stinking half-dead bodies. The PDF fired into the masses charging forward at them from the uttermost depths of the underhive, yet such were their numbers and their impossible resilience that it took multiple lasbolts and salvos to put them down. Ahead at the cordon line, the elite members of the Arbites barred the way with power mauls and shotguns, ignoring the clawing at their bodies that was the most common weapon available to the cult. Some of their hands had rotted so badly that the tips of their finger bones had become exposed, sharpened to claws by time or effort both. Others threw their own filth as a weapon, sending those who had not properly sealed their suits or worn the masks as proscribed into coughing fits that became blood flecked and fatal before too long.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead of them all, PDF and Arbites alike, was Razor Squad. The hab block’s quarantine efforts had been successful enough, for sure, but the source needed to be found more than anything else. The Blood Raven scouts slipped past groaning sentries with their fever burnt eyes, and over walkways slick with sick. The air itself was becoming corrosive, a mild discomfort to the space marines but something that could cause actual major harm to those less enhanced or protected. They did not even bother eliminating those in their way, finding it far easier to simply move past without being detected. They may have been scouts but by the reckoning of most they were more than worthy of promotion. Their sergeant, formerly of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company, would never attest to it, however. Not out of thinking otherwise, but rather preferring their experience and ability.<br/>
<br/>
Newly promoted scouts, for instance, would never be trusted with such a mission from the start of their careers.<br/>
<br/>
Silently, the target was found, hand signals more than enough to order the advance. An old, abandoned medical facility, it seemed. Not that there were many proper such places this far down, but rather it appeared that this place had been created by the community itself. A small bit of independent clinic work, innocents attempting to relieve their fellow man in a way that those who lived at the tops of the spires would never consider. It was a shame that it had failed so badly. It would never be known when those who ran it became corrupted, or why, but in the end, it didn’t matter. They had failed, and a place of healing had become quite the opposite to those with sane minds.<br/>
<br/>
Sergeant Ankit blinked heavily as his eyes found the most glaring sign of just what had happened to that place.<br/>
<br/>
It had been daubed in some disgusting mixture of bodily fluids and toxic waste products, but the symbol of Nurgle was unmistakable. More concerning was the fact it was glowing. Or rather, that the glowing was pulsing like some sort of heartbeat. The ground, metal and permacrete alike, was visibly rotting around the base of the building. There were more symbols around its walls, and likely more within. But it was more than enough. Still, he waited, pausing in his next instinct to call in the target coordinates for artillery bombardment as a pair of cultists emerged from the building. Both were monstrously swollen, skin peeling away in many places to reveal the feverish and maggot-ridden flesh beneath.<br/>
<br/>
“They come…they come…,” one said, the same droning tone that Ankit had heard before.<br/>
<br/>
Really, once their taint grew far enough, the cultists seemed to specifically get stuck into some single sentence or another.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes…yes they do,” the other replied, the difference in tone and level of control, making Ankit tilt his head. “But so does Ulkair…so does he! His prison is a broken, mewling thing, and it cannot hold him forever….”<br/>
<br/>
Then he turned, and Ankit reeled back as the needler rifle that had been hidden inside the hollow flesh of the cultist’s arm fired in his direction. The wall next to him was not so lucky. Even as he studied how the weapon was somehow hidden inside the arm – likely a result of bone turned rubbery and malleable along with musculature –  he began firing back. The rest of the scouts around him did the same. Ankit was, most especially, glad that he had ordered everyone in Razor Squad to bring quadruple the usual amount of explosives. They would be needed.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=========================================<br/>​</div>Gabriel exchanged a dark look with the rest of the Chapter’s leadership as Sergeant Ankit finished his report. The scout sergeant’s armor was scored and pitted, but he had managed to destroy the cult’s base without taking any casualties of his own. The PDF and Arbites had not been so lucky, but the cult had quite a horde of tainted humans on their side. The ensuing cullings that would be undertaken on Meridian would have to be exceedingly thorough, to the point that Governor Derosa had ordered the formation of another Meridian Regiment simply to partake.<br/>
<br/>
“You did the Chapter proud, Ankit. If there is nothing else…?”<br/>
<br/>
Ankit did not bother speaking in response, simply shaking his head.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
The communicator closed, leaving Gabriel to turn and look at his brothers. But words were not forthcoming, many simply thinking to themselves as to the threat that had unveiled itself. Gabriel had not personally been present for any of the battles on the planet Aurelia, but there were those present who had. Tarkus was not, but he had been there, and so there was little doubt that he would be at the least consulted on this matter. The traitor Avitus had been there as well, his bloody and body burnt with repeated applications of melta bombs upon its surface. Of Thaddeus and Aramus, there had not been word recently. Cyrus, however, merely looked pensive. It was Thule who spoke up instead.<br/>
<br/>
“The Great Unclean One <i>did</i> say that his prison would not hold him for long,” Thule said gravely, “It seems that he was not exaggerating. We must contact the Ordo Malleus.”<br/>
<br/>
“Would they bother coming?” Cyrus asked with a raised eyebrow. “We have not been on speaking terms much with them for some time now.”<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel glared at the cynical Captain who shrugged in turn before looking towards the dreadnought.<br/>
<br/>
“You are correct. The Grey Knights would not ignore a threat such as Ulkair breaking free and causing havoc once more. If his touch and influence is growing once more, then they <i>must</i> respond. I can speak with Inquisitor Toth, if he still lives, and you can speak to your contacts in the Grey Knights.”<br/>
<br/>
It was difficult to make a dreadnought frame nod, but Thule was adept enough to manage it, his hull bobbing with the motion.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well, Chapter Master.”<br/>
<br/>
It would not happen immediately, the Librarius had not even reported major warp distortions within the subsector, but he would not ignore something like this. He could not. Nor could he ignore the demands of the Inquisition, or the issues remaining with Vandis. At the absolute least, the greenskins and eldar would not trouble the sector for some time. At least, he hoped that was true. The Blood Ravens were still growing in strength, and yet still their foes came on. They would never stop, he knew, the fighting would never end. It was his fate as a space marine. And yet, he knew no fear at such a thought. For he was a Blood Raven, and never again would his chapter be found wanting if he had anything to say about it.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Lead The Chapter (All Technically Available):</u><br/>
[] Further Black Crusade Contributions – Send forces to aid in the Black Crusade, even though Aramus’s presence apparently counts enough for some. (Write-In)<br/>
[] Train 1st Company Battle Brothers In Terminator Armor Usage (Write-In Amount) [Note: Those selected will be unusable for any other purpose during the turn this option is selected i.e. 5 years.]<br/>
[] Assign Unassigned Battle Brothers To Companies (Write-In Battle Brother Allotment)<br/>
[] Assign Veterans To 1st Company If Desired (Write-In, If Desired, Not Required)<br/>
[] Assign New Fleet Additions (Write-In Fleet Assignments For Acquired Frigates/Destroyers/Gunships) [IF ANY AVAILABLE]<br/>
[] <b>Malleus Contacts</b> – Ulkair, the Great Unclean One who had been trapped within Aurelia and defeated in the Second Aurelian Crusade, is beginning to grow in power once more. The Blood Ravens, for all that their influence has waned significantly, retain some friends within the Ordo Malleus. Speak to them, for what aid might be gained.<br/>
[] <b>Deathwatch Desperation - Rise of the Alien:</b> The Deathwatch is being strained to the breaking point, by their own secretive messages to all Chapters in the galaxy who can hear them. Watch Fortresses and Stations are under assault, alien civilizations are rising in ever higher number, deadly threats are growing in severity and breadth. Normally only the best of the best marines would be given over to the Deathwatch, but out of sheer desperation the Ordos Xenos is loosening their standards in an uncharacteristic display of acceptance. That is, apparently, how bad the problem has gotten across every single Segmentum. Ordo Xenos Inquisitors are calling in favors, the Deathwatch is calling upon nearly every Chapter possible to send someone, anyone, as many space marines as possible. With such threats as the Black Crusade, the War for Armageddon, the Hive Fleets, all of the Deathwatch cannot hope to fight back against the apparent thousands of full-scale alien invasions of the Imperium going on across the galaxy without help. How could you possibly stand by and do nothing, in the face of this? (Write-In Additional Forces Sent To The Deathwatch)<br/>
[] <b>Deathwatch Campaign Offers:</b> The Deathwatch is being entirely overwhelmed. They are desperate for a great many more soldiers than many chapters are willing to give. They are, even, willing to give out targets to whole chapters that a single or grouping of kill-teams cannot normally defeat on their own. These are no mere minor invasions, but great gulfs of foes of extreme issue. It is highly advised that the Chapter focuses their efforts on only one of these potential targets at a time, else risk being similarly overwhelmed as the Deathwatch has been. Three major issues have been forwarded by the Ordos Xenos.<br/>
-[] <b>The Saharduin Swells</b>: The aquatic worlds of the vicious Saharduin – otherwise known as a bipedal race similar to the sharks of ancient terra – have somehow managed to remove the Imperial watch fleets set to watch over them. They have rapidly begun to rebuild their numbers, bearing somewhat Imperial-equivalent tech lines. An entire sector of Segmentum Ultima is now under threat. Their worlds are exceedingly difficult to invade, largely unexplored, and filled to the brim with their monstrous kind.<br/>
-[] <b>The Odaken Herd:</b> A new race, quadrupedal, heavily furred, with fully articulated ‘hands’ on each limb. Each is the average size of an ogyrn, and they bear strangely advanced terraforming tech – or at least Odakenning tech. They prefer ice worlds, subsisting on alien consumables and some form of symbiotic algae that grows upon their bodies. This means that they’ve been taking Imperial worlds and beginning to cool them beyond human habitation capabilities. They must be driven back, the worlds retaken before losing total human habitability permanently. But beyond that, their homeworlds must be found and destroyed while the Imperial Guard sees to the former.<br/>
-[] <b>Suysh Hives</b>: Reptilian creatures bearing advanced heating and microwave weaponry technology. A favored tactic is reaching close range and boiling the insides of smaller vessels, or melting soldiers in their armor. Previously just small pirate raids into the territory of the Imperium, they’ve launched a full-scale invasion from beyond the light of the Astronomicon. At the moment, they’ve entirely claimed a full quartet of superlatively lucrative mining worlds in Segmentum Ultima, and are working to claim more. A sector is under threat in terms of current fighting, and no Imperial Guard have been able to reclaim the mining worlds specifically, busied on fighting beyond them. The Suysh are using the worlds as their own new resource bases. It is not possible, currently, to find their homeworlds. For now, the worlds they’ve taken must be reclaimed first.<br/>
[] <b>Terminator Exchange:</b> Theodosia is willing to produce some Terminator Armor for you, having gotten those forges and designs online. But she will, one, require a full squad of marines with at least one psyker amongst them to safeguard the area - not that she doesn't trust the defenses and holy blessings of the Omnissiah, she just wants to ensure protection for your own equipment. And the hexagramic wards of the Blood Ravens should be especially valuable. Second, for each set of five terminator suits you desire built, she will require aid in other things, allowing her to free up production systems for what you desire. [1 Squad+Librarian Required To Help Oversee Production Whenever Selected. 1 Squad Required For Minor Favor Works In Exchange Per 5 Suits]<br/>

<u>Training For Gabriel</u><br/>
As Apollo's Skill Is No Better, Training Referred To Cyrus For Ballistic Skill, Last Skill To Be Improved Through Training<br/>
<br/>
<u>Train Your Chapter</u><br/>
The Blood Ravens have lost so many, both fresh blood and veteran. It may aid in the rebuilding of the Chapter for you to work upon them and try to impart the skill and experience that the Blood Ravens of the past once possessed. [Only Strength And Ballistic Skill Can Be Selected. Choose One for Main Training, And One For Secondary Training]<br/>
<br/>
[] Select Main Characteristic (1d100+Trainer)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher<br/>
<br/>
[] Select One Secondary Characteristics (1d50+Trainer)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos, Chief Librarian Probalis, and Apollo are mighty champions and can be deployed on operations. They need not remain in their ships doing nothing. To have them participate in an operation, it must be specified that they do so.<br/>
- If Ulkair is beginning to rise in power again, much is to be done to prepare for this, whether in numbers, arms, or allies. <br/>
- The Deathwatch seem desperate indeed, willing to take scouts, veterans, or even tomb-brothers, should they be sent to them.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Nero Gracchus – Chief Apothecary (Choose 2):</u><br/>
[] Implant Test-Slaves with Gene-Seed to harvest At Start Of Next Turn. Write-In the amount of Gene-Seed you wish to use. [Possess 279 Total Gene-Seed]<br/>
[] Implant Neophytes [2nd Stage] (125 Total)/ Psyker Neophyte [2nd Stage] (5 Total) with Gene-Seed.<br/>
[] Write-In<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus</u><br/>
- The Apothecarium is growing well, the trainees and graduates are a good boon to my efforts. I may even be able to focus all of my efforts on studying our gene-seed soon.<br/>
- The Arcanum may have the largest of our Apothecarium, but it is the Potentia that possesses the most advanced, as befitting its name. This should aid in the works of the Apothecarium for its purposes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Justinius Probalis - Chief Librarian (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Request to recruit and train potential psyker aspirants from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. High likelihood of successful training and implantation for recruits made in this manner.<br/>
[] The Raven's Talons: Justinius believes that it should be possible to craft weapons that would be highly effective against daemons and the malefic powers of the Warp itself, as Godsplitter is. With five usable shards taken from Wailing Doom of the Unknown Craftworld's Avatar of Khaine from Typhon Primaris, he believes he could make similar weapons. Whether another daemonhammer, a blade, axe, maul, or spear, he thinks it possible. [100 BP Per Raven Talon, Powerful Anti-Daemon Power Weapons, x4 Shards Remaining For Usage In A Weapon. <b>Success is not guaranteed for creation.</b>]<br/>
[] The Raven Aegis: The powers of the Warp and the daemons of Chaos are things that you know for a fact the Blood Ravens will face in the future. Creating talismans which would protect against such things would be incredibly valuable indeed. Justinius' successful efforts at using the materials of the fallen Avatars of Khaine from Craftworld Ulthwé has made him believe it possible to create such things. [50 BP Per Raven Aegis, Powerful Anti-Daemon/Warp Protection Talisman. x6 Shards Remaining For Usage In A Talisman. <b>Success is not guaranteed for creation.]</b><br/>
[] Something Else Entirely - (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider - Justinius Probalis</u><br/>
- The latest combat against the daemons of the Judgement of Carrion has made me think on the daemonhammer that the Chapter Master wields. We could, perhaps, use more of such weapons. It was created using a shard of the weapon of an Avatar. Perhaps we could make some ourselves, if we studied it enough?<br/>
- The Chapter's greatest advantage was its Librarians. I know that they were used for...ill purpose in the past by Kyras, but I will not allow such a political character to be assigned to them ever again. We were meant for more than that. For the betterment of the Chapter, for its coming battles, and the maintenance of the Sanctorium Arcanum, we must rebuild our ranks, and soon.<br/>
- If Ulkair is rattling his cage, we <i><b>need</b></i> more Librarians, and better weapons to wield against his ilk. Please, Chapter Master, I implore you to seek for ways to increase our numbers.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Martellus Ravias – Master of the Forge (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Build Order (675 BP Available)<br/>
[] Improve the Forges Of<br/>
-[] The Omnia Arcanum [0/1000] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>

[] Study The Hrud Fusils For ???? (Warning: May end up losing some Fusils as a result of the study) [0/????]<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of the Forge Ravias</u><br/>
- We should probably build more Tarantula turrets.<br/>
- The Forges could use improvement, I think. It is not blasphemy against the Omnissiah to improve what facilities we have, increase their capacity and sophistication.<br/>
- We have proven, now, our techmarine cadre to have the ability to properly construct the forges on our ships. We should continue this practice, for the Chapter is dangerously under-equipped compared to the strength it once possessed before the Purge.<br/>
- We should work to ensure that our ships possess Thunderhawks or some form of strike craft at the least in abundance for defensive and offensive purposes in void and planetary-combat. Especially if we plan on our ships engaging in such in the near future!<br/>
- Have we considered building more Tarantula turrets? Deploying them to aid our forces in upcoming fighting would be most valuable indeed, all things considered.<br/>
- Thank goodness the Potentia has returned to service. Amongst the rest of the ships within the Chapter Fleet, it possesses the most advanced forge facilities, as befitting its name. This will surely aid me in construction of more advanced technologies in the future, as well as their study!<br/>
- Our Chapter will remain low in number for quite some time yet. I believe that one of the best ways to alleviate such issues is the noble Tarantula turret.<br/>
- Hrud Fusils are prizes indeed. It is said they are an extremely advanced example of symbiosis between melta and plasma weaponry. I could attempt to study them, and discover if they may inspire further secrets of the Omnissiah in their nature - though surely not as if I would be committing to xeno tech-heresy. Obviously.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Cyrus Octavius – Master of Recruits (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Enact Blood Trials Upon All Four Of Your Viable Recruiting Worlds (Calderis/Trontiux III/Meridian/Junius) And Train Those Who Survive<br/>
[] Enact Blood Trails Upon The Following Of Your Recruiting Worlds (Write-In) [Note: If desired, as to leave one or more planets to grow their population, recover, out of lack of Gene-Seed for the potential crop, etc.]<br/>
[] Something Else (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of Recruits</u><br/>
- The only thing that can truly help the 10th Company is time, dedicated time, to train your initiates, neophytes, and scouts.<br/>
- With the arrival of many experienced 1st Company Sergeants, more Blood Trials can be enacted without Cyrus' direct observation.<br/>
- The Deathwatch would not ask so desperately if it were not needed. We could, conceivably, send scout marines to them. A number of these scouts would die, but they would die doing the Emperor's work. Those that survive would return with a vast amount of experience as well.</div>
