    <h2>Mechanicus Interlude: Aquila and Cog Part One</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: left"><i>GM Note: I fiddled with this for awhile now and decided that I should just post it. I can adjust it and answer questions as needed of course...</i><br/>​</div><div style="text-align: center"><b>Aquila and Cog<br/>

The warp twists and pulls before the <i>Litany of Fury</i> makes its way out into the materium once more. While it may have been more prudent to travel aboard the overall flagship of the entire Chapter it is the <i>Litany</i> which has been your transport for the past many campaigns and with it the <i>Sanctorium Arcanum</i>. You may be no Librarian but you know without question that when one wishes for fast and secure travel – as much as any travel through the warp can be – that the <i>Litany</i> outshines even the <i>Omnis</i>. With so much of your fleet in an uncertain state it seemed prudent to come to Zerann as quickly and safely as possible. Already the astropaths and more mechanically based communication systems begin speaking with the great orb of machines that lays before you.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master, our codes have been received and acknowledged,” a serf speaks up, hand still on the headset, “Magos Foratus gives warm greetings to his longtime allies in the Blood Ravens and inquires as to why we are here. Also he says…” the serf trails off before shaking their head slightly, “He says that he greatly regrets begin unable to aid against the traitor Kyras.”<br/>
<br/>
Briefly you close your eyes, and banish the small flicker of hope that you could contain that shame. No doubt the knowledge that so much of the Chapter and its leadership had become traitors and heretics has already spread. Your work in repairing the Chapter’s reputation will be long and hard.  Then you open them again and get ready to go to work once more.<br/>
<br/>
“Send the following: we appreciate your words, and wish to speak in person to speak of the state of our chapter fleet.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">====================================================<br/>​</div>Zerann 52X1 is slightly atypical to most normal Mechanicus worlds, which is not that unsurprising given that this entire Sector is on the very farthest fringe of the Imperium. Both the Emperor and Mars lay almost equidistant from both of your bastions. The whole of the planet is a close copy of the red world in that you can’t really see much of the planetary portions beneath the gargantuan fields of machinery and factories across the surface of the world. Clouds of smog and toxins pumped throughout the atmosphere would weaken and greatly reduce the lifespan of any mere human yet are no barrier whatsoever to space marines and the Mechanicus. You brood quietly on things while Martellus and Apollo remain perfectly motionless at your sides within the Thunderhawk, but the trip goes quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The landing platform is more than large enough for three Thunderhawks side by side, and waiting to greet you is both the Magos Foratus himself and a heavy group of Skitarii.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, Captain-…my apologies, Chapter Master Angelos, welcome to Zerann 52X1,” the heavily mechanized man says, sweeping an arm to gesture at the spires of metal all around you. “You spoke of your fleet?”<br/>
<br/>
“Indeed, in the process of purging the heretics many of our ships were damaged while others were destroyed outright.”<br/>
<br/>
Your eyes narrow slightly at the sight of a…fidgety Magos, but he soon straightens.<br/>
<br/>
“I apologize, we must conclude quickly. There are…eyes upon the Blood Ravens these days, and upon their allies.”<br/>
<br/>
Apollo grunts slightly and only mouths ‘Inquisition’ but the message is clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
Because of course any and all who dared have close relations with the Blood Ravens will be under great scrutiny. Zerann would be included in this, especially due to the fact that they are not the most traditional Forgeworld. They possess numerous warp technologies that are rarely produced in the entire Segmentum and even it is rumored secrets that stretch back to the Horus Heresy. Their attitude in keeping their knowledge under lock and seal is just one of the things that brought them into alignment with your Chapter. So of course the Inquisition is watching…they always are.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that going to be a problem?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, fear not Chapter Master…but if we could work quickly…”<br/>
<br/>
The major issue, of course, is that these sorts of negotiations cannot simply take place with mundane funds. The Astartes and Mechanicus are in an entirely different realm from such things, and so prices and costs come about more in the lean of favors large and small.<br/>

[] Choose Which Missions To Attempt, In Return For Ship Repairs. Mission Failure Or Failure To Perform Within Specified Timeframe Will Result In Cease Of Repairs.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Repair Costs</u><br/>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Battle Barge - <i>Scientia Est Potentia</i> [Major Favor Mission – Securing Aerus, Trontiux II Intervention, Carios Escort]</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Strike Cruiser - <i>The Great Father's Fist</i>[Major Favor Mission – Securing Aerus]</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Strike Cruiser - <i>The Howling Hatred</i> [Major Favor Mission –Trontiux II Intervention]</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Strike Cruiser - <i>Burning Seeker</i> [Major Favor Mission – Securing Aerus]</li>
</ul> <br/>
<u>Favor Descriptions, Choose From Here</u><br/>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><i>Non-Specified Favor For Later</i> - Instead of the other options, choose to be called on for any future major favors. This will give you time but will also require on your honor for you to respond immediately when the Mechanicus tells you. <b>Can be selected instead of the other options only <i>twice</i>. </b></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><i>Securing Aerus</i> – A Forgeworld lost during the Horus Heresy, recently reclaimed…partially. The Mechanicus is struggling to face feral machine constructs, orks, and various other problems for their reclamation teams. On the other hand, the opportunity for the Mechanicus to reclaim lost technologies from the time of the Horus Heresy is quite a rich one. Will require multiple Turns of Deployed Space Marines. [Hard] [Begin Within 2 Turns]</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><i>Securing Trontiux II </i>– While the nobles upon the world of Trontiux II may be upset at having such obvious intervention, the Mechanicus which holds true sway over all machines is not having it. The planet is undergoing far too much ork uprisings for Zerann to be comfortable with. They wish for you to assign some forces to clear them out. [Medium, Begin Within 3 Turns]</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><i>Carios Escort</i> – It may seem counterintuitive to ask you to contribute ships in return for having your current ships repaired but there it is. Subsector Carios has thus far remained unexplored by any force within the Imperium even including Rogue Traders. So now the Mechanicus is taking up the cause. On the one hand, it will be an Explorator Fleet with a fully furbished Ark Mechanicus, on the other, no one knows just what is out there. It could be anything from an entirely new species of xeno to fight or a heretic bastion or worse. Still, you would be allowed to choose what ships and what forces go with this though a minimum of at least 4 Ships and 30 Battle Brothers would be required until at least one System within the Subsector is fully explored. [Difficulty Unknown, Begins Within 4 Turns]</li>
