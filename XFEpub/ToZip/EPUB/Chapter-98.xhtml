+055.M42+ To +060.M42+<br/>
+<i>Let Your Fury Scour The Xeno Forevermore+</i></b><br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">From the warp they emerge, ships practically pristine to the naked eye. Imperious, unyielding, unfeeling, pure embodiment of their creed given form through ship and shape.<br/>
<br/>
"We have come," they broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
"We are here," was the reply.<br/>
<br/>
"Let the tithe be taken, in the name of the Emperor."<br/>
<br/>
And so it is done. Once again, Gabriel was forced to give up more than the normal percentage, a state of matters likely to continue for some time yet. Distant as the Blood Ravens were from Mars upon the very fringe of the Imperium, there would never be as much true regularity to the arrival of the Mechanicus for the tithe. Something that the Chapter, no matter their frustration, could do nothing about. The shadow of Kyras stood strong over every accomplishment and movement of the Blood Ravens, no matter their recent works. At the least it was only fifteen percent. And, of value, was the return of their brothers from across the galaxy, ferried across their ships by the ones they would always have a connection to. Another series of techmarines joined the forges, their training complete. An apothecary joined his brothers in matters of life and death. And so the Chapter continued to strive against the tides of fate which had nearly split it asunder again and again. All this, Gabriel knew, was not yet enough, and yet it was something. The eldar had not yet deigned to make an attempt within the Sector since their obliteration before. But that was no sign of their permanent departure. Nothing truly existed that could disprove the bloodshot glare of the Imperium towards the xenos.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there remain further xenos within the sector. Greenskins, of whom there seemed to be ever more, plagued the shipping lanes in their ramshackle pillaging ships, growing in savagery and number.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Crusade continues to churn, while there are rumors of a new Damocles Crusade to regain the worlds lost to the Tau in the Segmentum Ultima. Then again there are rumors of a Crusade to some point in the Imperium at nearly every moment, though the rumors here grow stronger and stronger. The remains of the Great WAAAAGH!! of Ghazghkull plague great swathes of the Segmentum Tempestus, battling Imperial forces, tyranids, and necron alike. Further east the worlds of Ultramar, where the living-yet-dead Primarch Robute Guilliman remains in stasis, are being surrounded and invaded from every direction by another seemingly endless swarm of the Hive Mind's thralls. More greenskins continue to appear to be heading towards the endless conflict of Armageddon. The Deathwatch continues, throughout all of this, to send desperate missives to every Chapter they can, favors aplenty and ancient contracts writ in blood and honor being called into play.<br/>
<br/>

[]<b> Korianis Hunting - Greenskins:</b> Greenskin raiders have been sighted across the entire Sector, and their Anchorage point is unknown. The Blood Ravens could work towards hunting them down. While this would not be the same as defending the worlds they raid, the routes they assault, but it would end them as a threat sooner, would it not? They have been noted to rely not on a few powerful ships, but frustrating mobs of smaller vessels, which swarm and board the vessels and outposts they currently raid. Their numbers are enough such that much of the sector is under threat, especially with many forces sent to Polonius for its settling.  (Write-In Forces Contributed)<br/>
[] <b>Korianis Defending - Greenskins:</b> Greenskin raiders have been sighted across the entire Sector, and their Anchorage point is unknown. While the Blood Ravens have no homeworld, it cannot be denied that this Sector is home to much of value to the Chapter, their recruiting worlds for instance. The Sector must be defended. Send out forces to patrol and work towards the defense of those under attack. The greenskins have been noted to rely not on a few powerful ships, but frustrating mobs of smaller vessels, which swarm and board the vessels and outposts they currently raid. Their numbers are enough such that much of the sector is under threat, especially with many forces sent to Polonius for its settling. (Write-In Forces Contributed)<br/>
[] <b>Deathwatch Desperation - Rise of the Alien:</b> The Deathwatch is being strained to the breaking point, by their own secretive messages to all Chapters in the galaxy who can hear them. Watch Fortresses and Stations are under assault, alien civilizations are rising in ever higher number, deadly threats are growing in severity and breadth. Normally only the best of the best marines would be given over to the Deathwatch, but out of sheer desperation the Ordos Xenos is loosening their standards in an uncharacteristic display of acceptance. That is, apparently, how bad the problem has gotten across every single Segmentum. Ordo Xenos Inquisitors are calling in favors, the Deathwatch is calling upon nearly every Chapter possible to send someone, anyone, as many space marines as possible. With such threats as the Black Crusade, the War for Armageddon, the Hive Fleets, all of the Deathwatch cannot hope to fight back against the apparent thousands of full-scale alien invasions of the Imperium going on across the galaxy without help. How could you possibly stand by and do nothing, in the face of this? (Write-In Additional Forces Sent To The Deathwatch)<br/>
[] <b>Deathwatch Desperation - Dire Demands</b>: The Deathwatch is being strained to the breaking point, by their own secretive messages to all Chapters in the galaxy who can hear them. Watch Fortresses and Stations are under assault, alien civilizations are rising in ever higher number, deadly threats are growing in severity and breadth. Normally only the best of the best marines would be given over to the Deathwatch, but out of sheer desperation the Ordos Xenos is loosening their standards in an uncharacteristic display of acceptance. That is, apparently, how bad the problem has gotten across every single Segmentum. Ordo Xenos Inquisitors are calling in favors, the Deathwatch is calling upon nearly every Chapter possible to send someone, anyone, as many space marines as possible. With such threats as the Black Crusade, the War for Armageddon, the Hive Fleets, all of the Deathwatch cannot hope to fight back against the apparent thousands of full-scale alien invasions of the Imperium going on across the galaxy without help. It may behoove you to request information from them, perhaps a target that your Chapter can go after, a force greater than any single kill-team. Surely they would allow this, ensuring that their duties may yet be discharged. (Information Will Be Received On Deathwatch Targets They Cannot Take Out Themselves)<br/>
[] <b>Terminator Exchange:</b> Theodosia is willing to produce some Terminator Armor for you, having gotten those forges and designs online. But she will, one, require a full squad of marines with at least one psyker amongst them to safeguard the area - not that she doesn't trust the defenses and holy blessings of the Omnissiah, she just wants to ensure protection for your own equipment. And the hexagramic wards of the Blood Ravens should be especially valuable. Second, for each set of five terminator suits you desire built, she will require aid in other things, allowing her to free up production systems for what you desire. [1 Squad+Librarian Required To Help Oversee Production Whenever Selected. 1 Squad Required For Minor Favor Works In Exchange Per 5 Suits]<br/>
[] Something Else (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Training For Gabriel</u><br/>
As Apollo's Skill Is No Better, Training Referred To Cyrus For Ballistic Skill, Last Skill To Be Improved Through Training<br/>
<br/>
<u>Train Your Chapter</u><br/>
The Blood Ravens have lost so many, both fresh blood and veteran. It may aid in the rebuilding of the Chapter for you to work upon them and try to impart the skill and experience that the Blood Ravens of the past once possessed. [Only Strength And Ballistic Skill Can Be Selected. Choose One for Main Training, And One For Secondary Training]<br/>
<br/>
[] Select Main Characteristic (1d100+Trainer)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher<br/>
<br/>
[] Select One Secondary Characteristics (1d50+Trainer)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos, Chief Librarian Probalis, and Apollo are mighty champions and can be deployed on operations. They need not remain in their ships doing nothing. To have them participate in an operation, it must be specified that they do so.<br/>
- It would be unwise to split our fleets between hunting and guarding against both the greenskins and Eldar. Better to focus our forces on one of the xenos or the other, or one of the tasks, such as focusing entirely on defense, or entirely on hunting. Otherwise our fleets might find themselves torn asunder piecemeal.<br/>
- The Deathwatch seem desperate indeed, willing to take scouts, veterans, or even tomb-brothers, should they be sent to them.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Nero Gracchus – Chief Apothecary (Choose 2):</u><br/>
[] Implant Test-Slaves with Gene-Seed to harvest At Start Of Next Turn. Write-In the amount of Gene-Seed you wish to use. [Possess 288 Total Gene-Seed]<br/>
[] Implant Neophytes [2nd Stage] (95 Total)/ Psyker Neophyte [2nd Stage] (6 Total) with Gene-Seed.<br/>
[] Write-In<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus</u><br/>
- The Apothecarium is growing well, the trainees and graduates are a good boon to my efforts. I may even be able to focus all of my efforts on studying our gene-seed soon.<br/>
- The Arcanum may have the largest of our Apothecarium, but it is the Potentia that possesses the most advanced, as befitting its name. This should aid in the works of the Apothecarium for its purposes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Justinius Probalis - Chief Librarian (Choose One):</u><br/>
[] Request to recruit and train potential psyker aspirants from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. High likelihood of successful training and implantation for recruits made in this manner.<br/>
[] The Raven's Talons: Justinius believes that it should be possible to craft weapons that would be highly effective against daemons and the malefic powers of the Warp itself, as Godsplitter is. With five usable shards taken from Wailing Doom of the Unknown Craftworld's Avatar of Khaine from Typhon Primaris, he believes he could make similar weapons. Whether another daemonhammer, a blade, axe, maul, or spear, he thinks it possible. [100 BP Per Raven Talon, Powerful Anti-Daemon Power Weapons, x4 Shards Remaining For Usage In A Weapon. <b>Success is not guaranteed for creation.</b>]<br/>
[] The Raven Aegis: The powers of the Warp and the daemons of Chaos are things that you know for a fact the Blood Ravens will face in the future. Creating talismans which would protect against such things would be incredibly valuable indeed. Justinius' successful efforts at using the materials of the fallen Avatars of Khaine from Craftworld Ulthwé has made him believe it possible to create such things. [50 BP Per Raven Aegis, Powerful Anti-Daemon/Warp Protection Talisman. x6 Shards Remaining For Usage In A Talisman. <b>Success is not guaranteed for creation.]</b><br/>
[] Anti-Anti-Psyker Study: The Split Heart Kabal made strange xeno advances in the baffling, diffusing, and blocking of psyker powers and abilities. By making a study of such things, the Librarius of the Blood Ravens would be able to train its forces against such things, improving their ability to defeat such things in the future while providing an additional aid of likely effectiveness against the vile Eldar specifically. [Note: This will mean that all non-Company Epistolary Librarians and Justinius Probalis are unusable for other tasks for 2 turns i.e. 10 years.]<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider - Justinius Probalis</u><br/>
- The latest combat against the daemons of the Judgement of Carrion has made me think on the daemonhammer that the Chapter Master wields. We could, perhaps, use more of such weapons. It was created using a shard of the weapon of an Avatar. Perhaps we could make some ourselves, if we studied it enough?<br/>
- The Chapter's greatest advantage was its Librarians. I know that they were used for...ill purpose in the past by Kyras, but I will not allow such a political character to be assigned to them ever again. We were meant for more than that. For the betterment of the Chapter, for its coming battles, and the maintenance of the Sanctorium Arcanum, we must rebuild our ranks, and soon.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Martellus Ravias – Master of the Forge (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Build Order (675 BP Available)<br/>
[] Improve the Forges Of<br/>
-[] The Omnia Arcanum [0/1000] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
-[] The Litany Of Fury [0/750] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
[] Construct Forge Facilities On Company Ships (Current/Former)<br/>
- [] The Ravenous Spirit [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The Spiraling Fury [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The Burning Seeker [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The Rage of Erudition [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The The Great Father's Fist [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The Howling Hatred [13/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The Legacy of Polonius [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
[] Study The Hrud Fusils For ???? (Warning: May end up losing some Fusils as a result of the study) [0/????]<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of the Forge Ravias</u><br/>
- We should probably build more Tarantula turrets.<br/>
- The Forges could use improvement, I think. It is not blasphemy against the Omnissiah to improve what facilities we have, increase their capacity and sophistication.<br/>
- We have proven, now, our techmarine cadre to have the ability to properly construct the forges on our ships. We should continue this practice, for the Chapter is dangerously under-equipped compared to the strength it once possessed before the Purge.<br/>
- We should work to ensure that our ships possess Thunderhawks or some form of strike craft at the least in abundance for defensive and offensive purposes in void and planetary-combat. Especially if we plan on our ships engaging in such in the near future!<br/>
- Have we considered building more Tarantula turrets? Deploying them to aid our forces in upcoming fighting would be most valuable indeed, all things considered.<br/>
- Thank goodness the Potentia has returned to service. Amongst the rest of the ships within the Chapter Fleet, it possesses the most advanced forge facilities, as befitting its name. This will surely aid me in construction of more advanced technologies in the future, as well as their study!<br/>
- Our Chapter will remain low in number for quite some time yet. I believe that one of the best ways to alleviate such issues is the noble Tarantula turret.<br/>
- Hrud Fusils are prizes indeed. It is said they are an extremely advanced example of symbiosis between melta and plasma weaponry. I could attempt to study them, and discover if they may inspire further secrets of the Omnissiah in their nature - though surely not as if I would be committing to xeno tech-heresy. Obviously.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Cyrus Octavius – Master of Recruits (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Enact Blood Trials Upon The Four Of Your Viable Recruiting Worlds (Calderis/Trontiux III/Meridian/Junius) And Train Those Who Survive<br/>
[] Enact Blood Trails Upon The Following Of Your Recruiting Worlds (Write-In) [Note: If desired, as to leave one or more planets to grow their population, recover, out of lack of Gene-Seed for the potential crop, etc.]<br/>
[] Something Else (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of Recruits</u><br/>
- The only thing that can truly help the 10th Company is time, dedicated time, to train your initiates, neophytes, and scouts.<br/>
- With the arrival of many experienced 1st Company Sergeants, more Blood Trials can be enacted without Cyrus' direct observation.<br/>
- The Deathwatch would not ask so desperately if it were not needed. We could, conceivably, send scout marines to them. A number of these scouts would die, but they would die doing the Emperor's work. Those that survive would return with a vast amount of experience as well.</div>
