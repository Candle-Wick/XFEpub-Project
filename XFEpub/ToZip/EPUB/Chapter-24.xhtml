+<i>To Admit Defeat Is To Blaspheme Against The Emperor.</i>+</b>​</div> <br/>
“Go forth, Captain, and serve the Imperium.”<br/>
<br/>
The young leader of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company, untested and unloved by his own brothers, nods to you once before turning towards the ships to take him to the ships. The <i>Arcanum</i> had not seen true battle in quite some time. That would now change. The horrors that lay waiting on the lost forgeworld would be a challenge for all who headed there now if only because of the fact that you had never fought them before. Not as the 3<span style="vertical-align:super">rd​</span> Company, now the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span>, and yet the annals of the chapter could only be improve by the knowledge and experience gained there. You can only hope that your former direct subordinates can learn to trust him as they did you.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, you will not throw them to the jaws of death without some aid. The Guard of Meridian have come as well, furloughing on the ships of the Mechanicus as they too head to Aerus. Along with them go a high number of specialized equipment and machinery. Even some of the relics of the Blood Ravens are allowed from the reliquary – so much the lesser after the purging and yet each a masterful item of great utility. And, should it become necessary, dreadnought chassis’ for those who may fall into that threadbare line between life and death. Even a hefty number of Martellus’s precious turrets. To preserve their sanctity in the first major mission outside of the Aurelian Subsector, you even send Hannibal and to aid them in all things possible you direct the Chief Librarian.<br/>
<br/>
It will have to be enough.<br/>
<br/>
<b>1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company, Chief Librarian, Master of Sanctity, 1 Techmarine, And Equipment Listed In Plan Unavailable Until Forgeworld Aerus Cleared! Time of Completion: UNKNOWN.</b><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">======================================<br/>​</div>Junius, the only one of the potential recruiting worlds that you inquired after to possibly be given over to you. The combined friction between Imperial factions and the general distrust surrounding the Blood Ravens made negotiations for the other two worlds utterly impossible and so it is to Junius that you turn your attentions. There are no grand arenas built there for you to claim a history of. No culture of serving and donating potential sons to the Astartes as most recruiting worlds possess. Worse, by claiming it as a Recruiting World you would be painting it as a grand target for destruction by the myriad foes that the chapter may face in the future.<br/>
<br/>
However.<br/>
<br/>
Needs must.<br/>
<br/>
You <i>need</i> more recruits, and while the Apothecarium works upon the creation of gene-seed through the slaves, you would ever need actual recruits for said gene-seed to be implanted into. Last year the Mechanicus proved perfectly willing to support you in setting up a new world. The Administratum…was far less eager. The resources that would be shifted about no doubt made someone unhappy at the potential for extra work. Nevertheless, you are resolute in your consistent communications with those within the sector’s heart. At the least, you will not have to negotiate with the Ecclesiarchy this time around. Perhaps in the future you should look towards repairing your relations with the Order of the Lost Rosetta…though given their nature you doubt that they will overlook the heresy that nearly consumed the chapter within even your extended lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">[Mechanicus Approval: Rolls Waived Due To Current Relations]<br/>
[Administratum Approval: 22]<br/>​</div>Alas, a minute sort of tragedy strikes.<br/>
<br/>
They…<i>lost</i>…your applications, and the records of your conversations. Within the vast labyrinth of bureaucracy that is the Adminstratum, the Blood Ravens for this year at least seem to have fallen between the cracks.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Administratum Lost Your Application. Failure. <br/>
Mechanicus abides. </b><br/>
<br/>

Tarkus looked dispassionately upon the gasping battle brother who laid upon his back, a great crack in the chest of his power armor. With a jerk of his arm he ripped the practice axe out of the marine’s armor and tossed it aside only to replace it with the weight of his own foot. Then he looked up at all those who stared at him, both from his company and others. Beneath him, the weakling attempted to shift or move but for the preposterous amounts of pain that wracked his body.<br/>
<br/>
“The pain that all of you are feeling like now is <i>nothing</i> to the fiery burning of shame that you shall feel when you fall to the enemies of the Emperor and go to his side as <i>failures!</i>”<br/>
<br/>
Kicking the fallen marine with his foot for good measure before reaching down to help him up, the Captain glared at them all and stabbed a finger out at the fighting pits within the guts of the <i>Litany of Fury</i>.<br/>
<br/>
“<i>Again!</i> You fall when <i>I</i> deem it acceptable for you to do so, not before!”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===============================​</div> <br/>
The slaves finally ceased writhing as the last of the chemicals pumped into the fluidic gel surrounding them. A great many cogitators recorded the data that even more scanners carefully brought in as each and every one of the precious gene-seed implanted into them was watched over. It would be a true tragedy if all of this work was for nothing. On the one hand what would be grown from these murderers and various other kinds of mortal criminal would not possess the true legacy of a space marine. On the <i>other</i> hand he would be able to rip out both of the organs implanted into them without a care for their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Five years.<br/>
<br/>
It would just be five years to double twenty-one into forty two. And so on and so forth over time. Perhaps they would not be filled with the great experience and knowledge of a true astartes…but honestly? He was willing to accept that for the survival of the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Caesar hummed a litany of purity as he tapped at one of the tubes, noting the way that the body within twitched on a dataslate in his off hand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>21 Test-Slaves Implanted! Gene-Seed Retrieval Occurs In 5 Years, aka. 007.M42</b><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===========================================<br/>​</div>Martellus is, like all those who fought alongside Aramus, unique in his learned skills. The Aurelian Crusades did much for him, pushing him beyond the brink to new heights when trapped upon Typhon. At the same time, they also gave him a rather unique breadth of experience when it came to relics. It was Martellus who handled the various relics and amazing pieces of wargear discovered and reclaimed during the Aurelian Crusades, and he has put that experience to good use. Not to say that he actually outright made a truly masterful example of the various kinds of technology and weaponry you demanded of him – but rather he was able to create each item with the same level of care that one who <i>specialized</i> in their creation would.<br/>
<br/>
Most admirable indeed.<br/>
<br/>
From the Forge rolls forth a new Razorback, named <i>Ardent Contempt</i>, wielding twin-linked plasma guns and a single lascannon. The formidable and ancient design known as a Mark 1 "Stronos" has long been sealed away from common or even rare usage. It is good that your chapter was gifted the designs long, long ago by the Iron Hand’s Chapter before the hammer of the Inquisition could finish eradicating the variant from the knowledge of so many. Powerful indeed, it shall provide heavy fire support and transport into the field of battle for many battles to come…or so you hope.<br/>
<br/>
That is not all, of course. A Land Speeder, of the Tempest variety, also flies forth soon after. Following <i>that</i> come the great number of Tarantulas that you commission. Martellus may hold an almost fetishistic love for the things but then again it was these that helped keep him alive when alone and trapped on Typhon against the ork and tyranid that infested the world. Another lascannon, two heavy flamers, and a pair of plasma cannons round everything out. All in all, a good amount of work for him to have completed.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the last of his creations is the one that takes the most personal care, though that is the nature of personalized bionics. The psyker is no mere astartes after all, and the considerable psychic might of Epistolary Maphar might affect lesser technological limbs that would have been grafted to him. A vaguely higher than middling amount of resources are spent on his arm but Martellus produces something that looks to you to have possibly come right off of the lines of Mars itself. It is smoothly detailed, glowing with the power of the electricity coursing through it. Mightier than even a space marine’s organic arm might be, Maphar is now in the possession of an arm twice as powerful as the one he possessed before.<br/>
<br/>
It is not <i>entirely</i> surprising of course.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Hands do have some small point about the difference between flesh and steel though you would never desire to go to the same extent as them willingly. Alas, your injuries from Kyras stole that decision from you.<br/>
<br/>
The year grinds to a close, and yet the forges of war burn on.<br/>

<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos and Chief Librarian Probalis are mighty champions and <i>can</i> be deployed on operations. They need not remain in the <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> doing nothing.<br/>
- You are slow. This must no longer be. Your agility <i>must</i> be bettered, you cannot allow these bionics to slow you forever! - While your Chapter rebuilds, it may be time to consider rebuilding the amount of Gene-Seed you possess through faster means i.e. test-slaves now that the <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> has been repaired.<br/>
