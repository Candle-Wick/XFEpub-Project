Of what was once one of the greatest fleets in the Imperium that could be held in the possession of any of the hundreds of chapters that made up the Adeptus Astartes, stalked a wolf. One of the last of its kind, in fact. The world of ice and war was gone, consumed by crystal and hate, and now one of the last of the thunderwolves padded its way along the chilly deck plates to snuffle and explore what would be its last home. It was, in fact, stalking a scent that it had caught only rarely before and now had nothing else to distract it from pursuing. Thus it stalked, padding here and there, nose pressed to a glowing rock in the metal-rock of the walls around it, and made its way through the doors which hissed open and closed behind it.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, here was the scent.<br/>
<br/>
Large tubes, in rows and rows and rows that were in this whole place driven so cold as to almost remind if of Fenris-Home. Within, the wolf tilted its head and licked at the frost-covered glass to examine the strange pulsating lumps within. Even from here it could smell the familiar scent of Fenris-Home in the flesh, despite how strange it seemed. Instead of the long-claws and axe-metal smells, the scent of blood and fight-pain-war, however, was the nothing but the cold instead. The wolf snuffled higher, and looked curiously upon the gleaming symbols that had been carved not just into the growing lump but in the glass-womb it grew in.<br/>
<br/>
“In the past,” a voice spoke up, and the wolf whirled in silence to follow a voice, a familiar one. “We would have chosen the best of those who proved themselves into the Fang, from across…our world.”<br/>
<br/>
The wolf’s gaze peered between the gaps in the metal and more glass-wombs so that it could peer at a standing Brother for whom visible energies crackled and flowed along its own long-claw. With the very tip of the long-claw, it carved more of the strange things into the skull of a resting Brother. New Brother? Hard to tell, but the smell was right. The body was right. It just was…different, at least until the Brother with its long-claw finished its work. Frost swelled and the wolf remained silent even as it yearned to snarl at the <i>bad-unnatural</i> feel of what swept through the room and into the runes.<br/>
<br/>
“But now…we are <i>all</i> Wolves. From birth…to death…I give you the wyrd of Haegr,” the Brother said, causing the Brother it stood over to shudder.<br/>
<br/>
“Is this what we are reduced to, now?” another voice spoke up, and the thunderwolf nearly yelped at the impossibility of one arriving in complete silence and un-scented on approach, yet it remained silent. “To…grow our new brothers from these <i>vats</i>?”<br/>
<br/>
“That is our wyrd,” the first Brother spoke to the second who even while looking at it the thunderwolf could not smell. “They <i>will</i> have the touch of Fenris in them, in their hearts and souls, even if Fenris is gone. They will have the memories, they will have…what we need them to have.”<br/>
<br/>
“What is the use of hypnotherapy and carving your runes into them to temper their souls…if they did not <i>truly </i>touch the plains of Fenris?!”<br/>
<br/>
The first brother whirled on the second, and lightning crackled along its long-claw.<br/>
<br/>
“BECAUSE FENRIS IS GONE!” the Brother howled, the grief so thick that the thunderwolf recoiled, as did the younger Brother who had spoken. With one hand, he grabbed the smaller wolf by the throat, and lifted him. “Because we are now, all of us, The Wolves that Stalk Between Stars! We <i>must bring Fenris with us,</i> for we are all that remains of it at all!”<br/>
<br/>
Then the long-claw brother threw its pup to the ground, to land at the foot of one of the glass-wombs.<br/>
<br/>
“Get out of here pup,” it hissed, “The Wolves will rise again, and we will have our <i>vengeance</i>! Against Magnus, against the Thousand Sons, the Dark Angels who dared to invade the Fang so brazenly, the Grey Knights who cut their way through our peoples!”<br/>
<br/>
“But the Great Wolf…said that they were lied to, tricked by-,”<br/>
<br/>
“The <i>Great Wolf</i>…,” the Brother interrupted with a growl, “Does not speak for us all.”<br/>
<br/>
Then the Brother put a hand to one of the glass-wombs, and began to carve runes anew.<br/>
<br/>
“They will be our brothers, in every way that we can make them. They will <i>have to be</i>,” the Brother whispered.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==============================<br/>​</div>There were now only wolves in Fenris, the system hollow and empty of all life but a huddled fleet. A wounded pack, which licked at its wounds and burned with hate and fury. And within every vessel, machines stirred as they gestated new life, new embodiments of what had been battered and broken yet refused to die. Wyrd was declared, and wyrd was given, unto them. No other world could give rise to those of the Canis Helix. No world remained for them, and so they would have no world again. There was not even a point in trying. Efforts turned to transforming the Canis Helix had ceased, there was no point. There was only the hunt, now. There was only the rage that burned through them all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there were only wolves in Fenris, a star system scrapped raw and clean of almost all life, and from before their births throughout their growing lives and souls, would they learn. The touch of Fenris would be <i>put</i> in them, the war chants to resound upon their wombs and echo in ears that were still forming. Some would twist, many would die, and more would find themselves screaming as the fur grew and their claws sharpened and their young and yet un-tempered minds shattered. And yet it went on, for now only the coldest of fury guided the wolves, and for their goal, for their hunt, for their Wolf Time, they would do what they needed to ensure that they would find the one who had cost them so much. From the Deathwatch. From every distant star system, every war zone, every fight was abandoned. There remained but one fight, one war, one endless struggle that every wolf alive had to answer. Not even Inquisitors could challenge, and succeed, the call, many a retinue departed by one of their number to go to where there was but only a hollow place in the soul and in the physical. Only those of the Wolfguard remained on Terra, but their demeanor was filled with a fell darkness that few dared approach them over. <br/>
<br/>
There were <i>only</i> wolves in Fenris. There would only ever <i>be</i> wolves in Fenris. Now and forever.</div>
