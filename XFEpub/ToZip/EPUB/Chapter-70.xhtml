When the first splinter arrived, few had been watching for it. Yet they were the chosen few, and knew well their duties. The Ordo Xenos had known such an occurrence was possible, and had been preparing for it. Unfortunately for them, they could not prepare enough. It was simply not possible with the resources on hand with the ongoing 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade consuming sectors all around the Cadian Gate in warfare. Chaos warbands and pursuing task forces clashed over dozens of worlds, and the anarchy caused by the Plague of Unbelief performed its own works in obscuring all things. The bloodshot eye of the Inquisition had been staring unblinking at the conflict for so long, trying to watch every single thing, and yet in the end found that it was forced to blink. A resurgence of orks left over from the defunct ‘Green Kroosade’, a sudden Hrud migration appearing in the midst of the battlefield between both Chaos and Imperium with an entropic sinkhole which rotted ships flying above into rust in hours, and more. All these contributed to that most dire of mistakes, yet it was not entirely the fault of those who had been so sternly warned.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the Subiaco Diablo System, they had been told. And so they did. When the space hulks arrived, first, spewing out orks in great numbers upon the beleaguered defenders there, they turned their gaze away. Here, then, were the xenos to be feared? Just orks. There were frothing madmen and heretics spewing out of the Eye to be fought, surely some other forces could be spared. Yet they did not notice until it was too late that the orks were in fact fighting amongst themselves, fighting their own kind, and this too was ignored despite the truth of the matter. For the greenskins could tell, admittedly after an extremely long time, that some of their kind were false, all outward appearances being enough but some inner bestial sense telling the truth. And so they fought, and the orks lost, too many of their number subverted, grown, gestated, in the long depths of the warp as the space hulks hurtled along to their destination whilst dragged by the waves of the immaterium roiling out of the Eye of Terror.<br/>
<br/>
As for the servants of the Plague God who had won the planet of the planet Subiaco Diablo itself? They too were steadily ground down by the orks and those who had infiltrated them. They fought hard, and long, and persevered with inhuman resolve as their God demanded. In turn, those who fought them slowly shed their disguises, their own secret brethren in the space hulks above finally unleashed in a tide of bio-plasma and chitin. For the tyranids had returned to feast and take advantage of the destruction being wrought across not just the Belis Corona Sector, but of the whole of the Imperium. The threat, unfortunately, was dismissed at first. After all, the splinter fleet of Hive Fleet Leviathan that had come but a scant few decades before had been destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
But this was not Hive Fleet Leviathan.<br/>
<br/>
This was a Hive Fleet that had slowly dragged itself through the warp, battling the denizens of the Warp all the way, to this place. Once a splinter of Behemoth that had steadily adapted itself against its most common foes, and grew in strength on a diet of flesh. Orks, constantly growing in number, had been as growing farms of flesh for the tyranids on their space hulks. Always kept from truly gaining and advantage, but used just as well. For the Hive Mind was not foolish, and not nearly as simple or regularly animalistic as the vast majority deliriously hope. It learned. It adapted.<br/>
<br/>
And Hive Fleet Diablo had certainly adapted.<br/>
<br/>
A tide of adapted flesh and claw soon sprawled out of the Subiaco Diablo system, the worlds there consumed utterly. The defenders, too weakened by the servants of Nurgle and other adherents to the Chaos Gods, the previous splinter fleet of Leviathan, and more, proved nothing more than more biomass to be incorporated. This time there was no sudden intervention by the mysterious eldar who had come before, and nothing to save the forces of the Imperium or that of Chaos beneath the ravenous jaws of the tyranids. Daemons were torn apart, their warp-flesh ingested and consumed at lightning speed before they could fully dissipate back into the immaterium. For the Hive Mind had learned, and the Hive Mind consumed all.<br/>
<br/>
Flesh. Minerals. The cores of worlds, and the light of suns. Mass and energy flowed into the Hive Fleet’s gestating wombs and further spawned out more tyranids to fight and kill. Here, now, not even the unnatural nature of daemons could prevent them from suffering from that most terrifying of things – complete cessation. For the Shadow in the Warp did not care from whence the food came, for in truth, all was food. All would be consumed. The Dark Gods recoiled at the touch of the Hive Mind, it’s Shadowed Presence far closer to a greater entryway into their realm than any other time before, and at its gaping jaws that would consume even them if given enough time and opportunity. If the Synapse Web grew strong enough, powerful enough, wide enough, that the Shadow could project its jaws across the intergalactic distances…but no. It could not. Not yet.<br/>
<br/>
And it would not.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Four snarled at the audacity of the Shadow, at the temerity of such a mind. A rebuke was required. An interruption in the greatest of entertainments could not be allowed to come to pass without response. A response born out of blood and broken bone. A servant was considered. Discarded. Too distant and unwilling to the point of pain to follow an open command. Another. It would not fight with the sheer lack of restraint desired, too focused inward on its own bitter hates. Another. Yes. Unrelenting in all things, the perfect of responses. Fury stoked at the loss of one of its own, yet still capable of being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
On a falling Fortress World, the acid rains of a heavily polluted sky changed from skin-melting green to the glorious red of blood. Lightning poured from thinning air from no visible source, and the eye sockets of all those who saw it began to bleed. The Shadow’s servants had begun to overrun all, heaving bio-titans stomping over the shattered remains of defenses that had seen off many a Black Crusade without falling, and yet it could not avoid its attention being dragged forth. And there were few who would miss such a thing, as a planet-shattering wrath was inflicting on the psyches of all. Thousands died instantly as their hearts failed them, while thousands more went mad with unnatural bloodlust. They could not help it as they tore at their own wrists and the throats of others all to spread the blood.<br/>
<br/>
The Daemon Primarch Angron hacked open the universe with one blow of his whirring axe, and walked through to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him were tens of thousands of true devotees to the Blood God, and they brought with them weapons aplenty to shed the blood of the Shadow’s get. Daemons belching black smoke and drooling liquid brass dragged themselves on treaded appendages, guns grafted to their spines large enough to pierce the smogs of the world with a single blast. It was a force to break worlds, break entire sectors, and to shatter the mind of weaker willed men on sight. Angron roared his defiance, the blood falling from the skies transforming into piercing needles and suddenly shooting <i>up</i>, shredding apart hundreds of tyranids in a single instant.<br/>
<br/>
The Hive Mind shifted its attentions, and obliged.<br/>
<br/>
Within a day, there was no life on that world but daemon and tyranid, and no fortifications not made of chitin and xeno flesh  or daemonic construction. Within a week, mountains of tyranid corpses had been left in the wake of the Primarch. A hierophant was ripped in half by the raging daemon prince’s bare hands and teeth, and yet another fell onto the primarch’s position not a moment after. Flesh that was dead, was reclaimed, reprocessed, and spawned anew. The daemons cackled, they screamed, and they fought. Blood spilled in great channels that stained the ground and infected the biosphere of the planet with the indelible taint of the Shadow of the Warp. An entire half of the Belis Corona Sector was lost to the whirlwind of fighting between Chaos and the Hive Fleet, the Imperium desperately trying to shore up what defenses they possessed on what worlds they still held.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, in four more sectors, and many more subsectors besides, the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade ground on.</div>
