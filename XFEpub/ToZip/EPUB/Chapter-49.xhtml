It was too easy.<br/>
<br/>
Which, in truth, was a pathetic thing to acknowledge. For all of their strength, for all of their pride, for all of the good they had done and could do, they were nothing before him. It was a pittance of effort to confound them, to trick them, to lead them about the nose like the near dogs they had let themselves become as the years had gone on. To serve the Emperor like hounds yet uncollared, for all that the Space Wolves could have been, for all that the War Hounds turned World Eaters had been. Yet he had defeated them too many times for him to hold a true respect for them anymore, a bitter truth in and of itself. It had eaten at him and left him near hollow, like the rest of his experiences in the galaxy, but it was not enough to fell him. Nothing like that could, not anymore. <br/>
<br/>
All it required was a hint.<br/>
<br/>
A whisper.<br/>
<br/>
A shadow seen in profile from behind by a recording camera.<br/>
<br/>
A display of heraldry as he went about some small works of his inconsequence.<br/>
<br/>
Like dogs – no, not like dogs. Like lambs to the slaughter. And yet in this, they would be more likely than not the killers this time around as before. A miscalculation had already nearly doomed another that he had no time or even thought for beyond casual acknowledgement. Sloppy work, too sloppy, but there was nothing for it now. Too many pieces, too many games, too many all at once and yet he refused to stop, could not stop now after so long and so much. Instead he fought on, and dragged himself forward and through. They came, then, as he knew they would. So simple to make it appear as he was more than he was. So easy for them to gather themselves up in shame and come forth as a true sword.<br/>
<br/>
The Dark Angels hunted him, desperate for a redemption beyond what they feared already. The Lion’s sons came, and the sons of those sons with them. They burned forth from the warp with the knowledge of what they had done, with the eyes of the Inquisition now firmly on them and the potentially forever hate-bound glares of those they had doomed in their acts, and just as his very presence and those of his brothers could create they were filled with an unrivalled fervor. To capture, to hunt, their own ‘repentance’ that they demanded of his kind in a magnitude above. In greater numbers than they had been in so long were they unified, and yet the plans of the past, present, and future had fallen aside so completely that not even he knew what was supposed to happen next. How could he, when the very fates themselves had disappeared into unknowable designs and shapes after he had relied upon them for so long?<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Make it appear as though he was close. That he was deep within the paranoia filled brutal inner circle of commanders that the Blackheart held to him and they would come doggedly after.<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Like dogs they came, and like dogs they were. They chased, and ran, and as they plunged their Rock and their fleets and their sons into the Blackheart’s flanks, he would go about and do his <i>own</i> works, that which truly mattered.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=====================================================<br/>​</div>“Redeploy our ships!” Huron bellowed, his own commands passing through the blessings of Chaos itself to impose upon the very wills and souls of those who served him.<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to call for ‘grids’ or ‘sectors’ when one such as he demanded his slaves and temporary allies moved as he desired. He had learned long ago that to rely on but words and deed was worth nothing to him, worth nothing to stop the tide of his foes. No, it was his mind and his will alone which needed to be followed, and without question, with total collusion with what he desired such that it could be invoked upon reality itself. And just as he knew they would, he needed not see but instead felt through his command throne and his own powers that several packs of frigates and cruisers tilted themselves against the suddenly arrived Rock and its escorting fleets.<br/>
<br/>
Below him, far far below him, the Khum Kharta Mountains and the precious Fortress-Monastery of the White Scars stood defiant against him still. His troops, his slaves, his mutants, his cults, had swarmed the surface of the planet below and even as their precious ‘Empty Quarter’ was set alight they defied him. Worse was the fact that their powerful void shielding and retaliatory strikes of their defense laser was preventing a truly proper set of orbital strikes upon them to break their nearly impenetrable home. But it was no matter. In truth, he had afforded a great many of his chaos space marines gathered throughout the galaxy into the maelstrom in order to keep them bottled up as just that. There was plenty more for him to pillage and plunder elsewhere on the planet despite the best efforts of their guerilla bike squads attempting to stop him.<br/>
<br/>
Let them stand proud on the top of their precious peak while the rest of their world burned.<br/>
<br/>
Besides which, he was busied with the sudden arrival of the Dark Angels.<br/>
<br/>
His mind expanded, briefly, to feel the roiling minds and animalistic desires of his many, many daemonships and their crews. And with barked orders, he twisted off his ships in great masses to both match themselves against The Rock and those that they had brought with them while the others remained chasing the ships of the White Scars and their successors all over the system. He had the ships for it, obviously, unto the Legions of old. His Legion. The Red Corsairs, all his own. For a brief moment Huron allowed himself to luxuriate in that pride as he felt the Imperium languish beneath the attentions of those that they had spurned.<br/>
<br/>
Those that they had betrayed.<br/>
<br/>
Was it any wonder that his forces had swollen as they had? After the Imperium betrayed so many, corrupted so many, abandoned so many, how could he not possess what he did now? How else could he have bound so many in chains of hate and servitude to a better master than some corrupt false dead creature on a throne so far away? It burned and should burn further in the hearts of those that quailed before his mighty assemblage that so many who had become ‘traitors’ by necessity, out of sheer need for survival, named renegade and forced to fall further and further? But now they had returned, and under his masterful hand had worlds burned, and more would burn, until all of the bloated <i>thing</i> that was the Imperium felt the sting of those that they had done their best to ruin.<br/>
<br/>
But this! This was unforeseen, and for that he knew there would be executions in the cabals of his sorcerers. How could the Rock be here? If anything, this looked to be almost the entire Dark Angels Chapter in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
“Fools,” he grunted.<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t matter. One Chapter, even of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Founding, did not matter.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you not see,” he hissed as more of his battleships shifted to perhaps even destroy the precious Rock itself, “How can a Chapter be matched by MY LEGION!!!”<br/>
<br/>
His answer, as if Tzeentch himself had been listening, came but moments later as dozens of new registering ships appeared from the warp from behind the Rock. He felt the dull phantom pain as a swathe of his frigates were lost to the blazing light of the Rock’s weaponry, but more of his mind was consumed with the examination of so many different ships bearing the emblems of Dark Angel successors. Far more than there should have been. It was…no, it was impossible. Not in their movements, none of their ships, none of it should have been possible, not at his moment of triumph!<br/>
<br/>
“No…no I have a Legion. I have a LEGION! YOU ARE NOTHING!” he screamed, spit flying from his lips as the great rages of Khorne himself seemed to settle in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
They were just chapters, chapters of one Primarch, but chapters all the same. There could not match his painstakingly crafted legion. They could not! He would not let them!</div>
