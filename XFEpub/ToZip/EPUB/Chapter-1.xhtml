    <h2>Character Creation - Part 1</h2>


Spoiler










Within the borders of the Empire of Man, the Elector Counts are among the highest of nobility, second only to the Emperor and - arguably, very arguably - the High Priests. Their word is all but law over the countless thousands of souls within their province.

You are not an Elector Count. But you are the next best thing.

You have secured a position in the Privy Council of a newly-arisen Elector Count, an instrument for their will in a specific domain. But also an instrument for your own will; because like all people, you have your own ambitions. The way you present information, the solutions you present, the options you put towards them and how you explain them; all of these will allow you a great deal of leeway in how you go about your business, and to pursue your own private goals.

The first question is: in what province have you come to power? Noble Reikland, advanced Wissenland, vast Talabecland, mighty Middenland, drunken Ostland... you do not have the fortune to serve in any of these. Your province is somewhat... humbler.


[ ] STIRLAND

There is much that is good that one can say about Stirland. The land itself is one of rugged highlands and flowing rivers, known for its faithful, doughty populace. The capital, Wurtbad, is especially famed for fine wines, luxurious inns and hot springs. Taken in isolation, Stirland would be a fine province to live in, which just goes to prove the importance of location.

Because Stirland's location is right next to Sylvania.

Cursed Sylvania, haunted Sylvania. Sylvania, the homeland of vampires, the wellspring of death and corruption, the endless font of things that go bump in the night. The fate of Stirland is to forever to be the bulwark which wave after wave of the undead crash against, taking an eternal toll in lives and coin. Without end and without thanks, the people of Stirland suffer under the depredations of the dead so that the rest of the Empire do not have to. A necessary and admirable task, admittedly, but given the choice, wouldn't you want to live elsewhere?

Benefits:
1. Reliable People: The populace of Stirland are steadfast and pious.
2. Low Expectations: With most good candidates finding somewhere less... Stirland-y... to practice their trade, incompetence is expected and competence will be considered greatness.
3. Knights of Morr: The silent and terrifying guardians of Morr's holy sites are a fantastic help in the endless fight against the undead.
4. Zhufbar: Good relations with the capital of Dwarven engineering are only mildly hindered by having to go either around or through Sylvania to reach you, and they have a keen interest in keeping Sylvania pacified.
5. Untapped Potential: Both in the bucolic backwater of Stirland proper and, if it can ever be brought to heel, in 'Eastern Stirland' - Sylvania.

Detriments:
1. Sylvania: Just... Sylvania.
2. Stauch Traditionalists: Outside of extreme circumstances, the locals are unlikely to take well to changes without a lot of effort.
3. A Moot Issue: It seems a second curse is on Stirland - an eternal inability for its Elector Counts to let go of the rich farmlands that once belonged to them, and were handed over to the Halflings of the Moot.


[ ] AVERLAND

Averland is an open and sunny province, full of farms and grazelands, framed on three sides by rivers and on one by mountains. The populace are open and generous, and the nobility are usually more focused on their cattle herds than on political intrigue. They enjoy close relations with the dwarves, are free of the beastmen-infested forests that cast gloom over most of the Empire, and their plentiful harvests are supplemented by exports of minerals, gems, and furs.

There are two things keeping it from being a truly happy place to live. The first is Black Fire Pass, the main passable route through the mountains that border the Empire to the south, gateway to not only trade partners but also the endless hordes of greenskins and darker things that lurk in the Badlands and beyond. The second is a longstanding tradition of eccentricity, verging on insanity, in the rulers of Averland. These ensure that life is never peaceful for too long.

Benefits:
1. Clear Skies: Averland shares with Wissenland the blessing of being unforested, leaving them largely free of the Beastman taint.
2. Black Fire Pass: The main overland trade route from the Empire to Tilea, the Border Princes, and a dozen major dwarfholds, Black Fire Pass is a prestigious and profitable fixture in the province.
3. Order of the Black Bear: A tempestuous and easily-bored knightly order, when they aren't engaged in battle they hone their skills in tourneys and games.
4. Dwarf Acquaintances: Between their stable ties to the minor hold of Karak Angazhar in the Black Mountains and their trade routes to the greater dwarven realm through Black Fire Pass, Averland enjoys closer ties to the taciturn dwarfs than most.
5. A Fertile Land: Next to the rivers that border Averland on three sides, harvests are bountiful, and almost all of the rest of Averland is good grazeland for the hardy and intelligent Averland Longhorn.

Detriments:
1. A Bit Odd In The Head: Averlanders are a flighty and changeable lot, liable to change their mind at the drop of a hat and resisting any attempt to hold them to an agreement.
2. A Lot Odd In The Head: Averland's rulers tend to take the flightiness of the average Averlander to new and interesting extremes.
3. Chink In The Armour: Being the main entrance into the Empire's southern border, Black Fire Pass attracts many unfriendly visitors. It would be nice if it was only greenskins that came knocking.
4. Bloody Sylvania: Though Stirland takes most of the brunt, it's never a fun to have a land border to that accursed place.


[ ] HOCHLAND

Oh, yeah. There's also Hochland.

That's Hochland for you - always the afterthought. The smallest province, the least populated province, the province without rowdy foreign neighbours or interesting technologies. Sure, they're good with guns, but Wissenland has bigger and better guns. They've got a school of magic, but Reikland has a much bigger and much older school. They're a crossroads, but Talabecland is so much more so. The Middle Mountains is a place of great interest and danger, but Nordland and Ostland also border them.

If Hochland stands out in any one way, it would be their people. Hochlanders are loyal and brave, open-minded and tolerant, and almost universally highly skilled woodsmen and marksmen; they thrive under the shadow of the woods that strike terror into so much of the Empire.

Benefits:

1. Enemies Within: But, unless things go terribly wrong, no enemies without. All of your neighbours are fellow provinces of the Empire, and as such your borders can be considered probably secure.
2. (a) Crossroad of the (north-eastern) Empire: exposure to so many strangers going this way and that has made Hochlanders some of the most open-minded and tolerant people of the Empire, as well as bringing in generous amounts of trade and tourism.
3. Self-sufficient: Between farming the few unforested areas and hunting in the rest of it, trade is a luxury to Hochland, not a necessity.
4. School of Wizardry: Though nowhere near as grand as those in Altdorf, having close access to wizards is useful (and dangerous) in a wide variety of ways.
5. Many Faiths: In an effort to squeeze tourists and passers-by of their coin, shrines to every acceptable god have flourished and a small priesthood of almost every god can be found.

Detriments:

1. Landlocked: No coasts and surrounded by other Imperial provinces, you possess no way to make contact with foreign powers without going through another province.
2. Small: Hochland has less land and less people than any other province of the Empire.
3. Unremarkable: Apart from being skilled woodsmen, Hochland does not really stand out in any one area.
4. Painfully Aware Of It: In their attempts to overcome the status of last among equals, Elector Counts of Hochland can sometimes be... unreasonable.




Secondly, you must select which position you are filling. Traditionally, there are six advisors in an Elector Count's privy council, each serving a very different role.

[ ] Martial: The Marshal is in charge of military matters, second in command to the Elector Count themselves. It is a position of great power, but also one of danger and responsibility - though it can be led just as well from the back as from the front. And in times of danger, where better to be than surrounded by armed and loyal men?

[ ] Diplomacy: The Chancellor is responsible for contact both within and without, handling relations with both foreign powers and the people of the province. At first glance they may have little direct power, but can easily accrue influence and allies from the many circles their job requires them to move within.

[ ] Stewardship: The Steward is responsible for taxes and the economy, giving you direct access not only to your own budget but to all incoming wealth as well. A heady position, but also one that attracts a lot of blame when things go poorly, and a lot of expectations to be able to wave a wand and make money appear.

[ ] Intrigue: The Spymaster is the master of soft power in the realm, responsible for hiding the Elector Count's secrets and uncovering those of everyone else. Gives you a great deal of leeway in how you go about things, but also makes you a target for everyone trying to get away with skulduggery in the province, and being anything short of omniscient is often considered a failing by those that don't have to do the job.

[ ] Faith: Almost always filled by a priest or cleric, but sometimes by a neutral ambassador able to work with the heads of various local faiths. The job is often akin to trying to herd cats when the cats all hate each other, but being responsible for the souls of an entire province is sought after by some.

[ ] Learning: The most nebulous of all the roles, this role is usually filled based on the Elector Count's desires and prejudices. The realm of madmen and geniuses, wizards and witch hunters, all seeking new ways to build and to destroy. May result in you having incredible amounts of leeway, or may result in you being forced to pursue whatever flight of fancy captures your lord's attention, and if it's a terrible idea you'll get the blame for it.


Motivation:

Unlike the Elector Counts, one does not inherit a position in the Privy Council by chance. One attains it through great effort or great skill. To achieve such a thing, something must be driving them. Select your private agenda.

[ ] Avarice: To be an advisor to an Elector Count is usually a well-paid position, but even greater opportunity can be found with the lucrative projects and bountiful budgets such a position has access to.
Bonuses to embezzlement attempts and other profitable avenues; willpower rolls to keep from dipping directly into the budgets you control if you make no off-the-books income or other improvement in personal wealth in a particular year.

[ ] Vainglory: The role of advisor is prestigious, certainly, but hardly glorious - unless you go above and beyond the call of duty, and sometimes above and beyond what was asked of you, and sometimes even above and beyond sanity and rationality.
Bonuses to large, revolutionary, or otherwise impressive projects or achivements; maluses to more mundane assignments.

[ ] Nepotism: You have a large family, many of whom are eager for prestigious and well-paying jobs. You do this for them because you love them, of course. Actually getting some peace and quiet at home is just a side-benefit.
Reliable source of very loyal candidates for key roles; malus to all rolls if these positions are not found on a regular basis. A very prestigious position might buy you a few years, or you could fill sundry middle management positions every year.

[ ] Inspiration: To you, this position is merely a stepping stone towards a pet project that consumes you.
One inspired super-project of dubious utility and questionable safety with bonuses to working towards it when given official permission; minor maluses to all other projects as you neglect them in favour of tinkering with your passion. Completing a super-project will give you peace for a few years until a new one occurs to you.

[ ] Zealotry: The Empire is a land of many faiths - the Sigmarites and the Ulricans primarily, but countless others as well. You, of course, know that only one of them is true, and will work to eliminate all false faiths.
Bonuses to working to further your faith; maluses to working with people outside of it.

[ ] Sleeper Agent: Perhaps you did not quite attain the position; perhaps it was thrust unto you, and perhaps those that did the thrusting have attached several strings to the position.
Only required to pass on information, making it usually less burdensome than other motivations; sometimes you may be tasked with seeking out specific information, and in special circumstances you may be required to intervene and risk revealing yourself. You're not entirely sure who your true master is, but they seem benign.

[ ] Corruption: Loyalty to the darker powers has great costs, but greater rewards. Or was it the other way around?
Choice of Chaos (access to blessings of Chaos) or Vampire Counts (access to Necromancy and Vampirism); the downsides to such domineering overseers are as obvious as they are numerous.



Hi everyone. I'm a long-time reader, first-time quester, though I have a number of years of experience with GMing. An idea sprang into my head the other day and wouldn't leave me alone, so I started writing it out and now here we are. I request your patience and cooperation as I learn the ropes.

In CK2 quests you have your advisors, a handful of descriptive lines updated every half a decade or so that regularly spit out three or more neat little options for how to improve your lot in life. They are almost always trusted implicitly even among the most paranoid of threads unless they're described as twirling a moustache and carving chaotic sigils into the meeting room table, and I wondered what their life was like when they weren't delivering their annual reports. Do they truly have no desire other than to serve you, or do they have murkier motivations than their lord ever sees? When they tell you it will cost ten thousand gold to build new roads, will it actually cost that, or did they round it up from 9700 and change and pocket the difference? When a factory is built, is it staffed entirely along meritocratic lines? When you send a few thousand men to go punch goblins in the face, does all the loot they find make it's way back to you? And when they tell you that the people will be satisfied by no less than a new and grand cathedral to balm their souls, how do you know that a few extra local churches wouldn't do the job for a fraction of the time and effort?

So now it's time to put you in that role and see how you do. It's not that you're disloyal, exactly. In fact, you're very loyal. It's just that not all that loyalty is to the same person.

SV, it's time to cook the books.


Minutiae:

The year will be 2470, in the reign of Luitpold I. Your Elector Count will be created from scratch, unknown to you and brand new to power at the start of the quest. Any events past this point are, for the purposes of this quest, non-canonical. Karl Franz is not yet born; whether the Emperor will have such a blessed son in this timeline is entirely up to the whims of the dice. Don't expect the End Times to start encroaching right on schedule, or even, necessarily, at all.

As you may have deduced, this quest will use the CKII-style system made famous in previous quests, with all due thanks to those that came before - Gaius Marius and torroar leap to mind, but many others have been part of the trend that proved so inspirational.

Your choice of position will influence what backgrounds will be available to you; an intrigue advisor will have the option of having been a Witch Hunter, and a martial advisor may have been a Knight, but if you were to be a steward those backgrounds will, of course, not be suitable. Mage backgrounds of varying colours will be available for all positions but Faith, but expect them to have a significant opportunity cost.
