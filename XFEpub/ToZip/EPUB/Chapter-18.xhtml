<b><u><span style="font-size: 1.125rem">Uncertain Loyalties - an Advisors Quest</span></u></b><br/>
Within the borders of the Empire of Man, the Elector Counts are among the highest of nobility, second only to the Emperor and - arguably, very arguably - the High Priests. Their word is all but law over the countless thousands of souls within their province.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, at least.<br/>
<br/>
In practice, many of them are constrained a thousand ways by the chains of command. Obligations of law and custom, duties to Emperor and to subjects, treaties with other Elector Counts and with foreign nations, gods-damned paperwork, outbreaks of orcs and undead and chaos cultists and other threats demanding immediate response at the cost of attending to practically everything else, shortages of money and manpower, the endless bickering of petty nobles wanting you to adjudicate, and simple inability to be everywhere at once means that even Elector Counts are sharply constrained in the extent of their rule. Needing to sleep doesn't help either. And some have it even worse than this.<br/>
<br/>
Like you. What made you particularly unsuited to be Elector Count?<br/>
<br/>
[] SPARE TO THE THRONE<br/>
Your first brother, taken by the plague. Your sister, abdicated after scarce two years and already withering with stress. Your second brother, killed in a hunting accident. You were not expected to take the throne, and know only the very basics of ruling, being twice inexperienced for your youth as well as lack of proper tutoring. You're not young enough to formally need a regency, but that won't stop some of your older advisors trying to regence on your behalf anyway.<br/>
<br/>
[❌] WAR HERO<br/>
With the previous dynasty of Elector Counts in this province having come to an untimely end, the Electors came together in a special meeting to find a replacement. After a week of factioning around their own friends, they settled on you as a compromise candidate: a veteran warrior, well-decorated, known for dutiful loyalty to the Empire and stalwart rectitude, if perhaps rather unimaginative and unsuited to politicking.<br/>
<br/>
[] SICKNESS UNTO DEATH<br/>
During the first year of your nominal reign, you took ill and fell into a coma. On death's door, preparations for the succession were already being made when a Jade Wizard intervened to say you would live and not die, so there was a regency. It lasted rather longer than planned. Two years later, you are finally conscious enough to carry out the duties of office, but still dreadfully weak, and your nominal subordinates and advisors have gotten used to getting their own way without your meddling.<br/>
<br/>
[] LETHAL JOKE CANDIDATE<br/>
The last Elector Count was a little odd. When he returned a favour you performed for him by adopting you into his household, people shrugged. When he seemed to be infertile (or frigid?), people started to worry. When he died and his last will explicitly specified that the position should pass to you as though you were the son of his body, people objected quite loudly... but in the end, decided that you were probably better than risking a civil war.<br/>
<br/>
[] THE FOP<br/>
Rank is supposed to be a <i>privilege</i>, not a responsibility! Court is for enjoying oneself. The flattery may be insincere, but does it really matter as long as they keep it up? In your view, your power and position are supposed to be for occasionally taking the visionary decisions that earn you glory and a place in the history books, not this constant stream of unimportant bullshit. Surely there's someone you could hand such things off to.<br/>
<br/>
[ ] CORRUPTION<br/>
Loyalty to the darker powers has great costs, but greater rewards. Or was it the other way around?<br/>
Choice of Chaos (access to blessings of Chaos) or Vampire Counts (access to Necromancy and Vampirism); the downsides to such things are as obvious as they are numerous. You will have to be fairly reclusive.<br/>
<br/>
<i>In CK2 quests, you have your advisors, a handful of descriptive lines updated every half a decade or so that regularly spit out three or more neat little options for how to improve your lot in life. They are almost always trusted implicitly even among the most paranoid of threads unless they're described as twirling a moustache and carving chaotic sigils into the meeting room table, and I wondered what their life was like when they weren't delivering their annual reports. Do they truly have no desire other than to serve you, or do they have murkier motivations than their lord ever sees?<br/>
So in this quest, advisors will be a lot more important. Your advisors will all be fully statted characters who have attributes of their own and motivations divergent from yours, and you'll be playing the nominal boss who is very limited in 1) capacity to act, 2) your knowledge of the advisors, 3) the advisors' loyalty to you. Most state actions will have to be performed by asking one of your advisors to do them. How well they perform will depend on their attributes, not yours. You start out not knowing their attributes, either, until you take investigation actions. Worse, if your advisors are disloyal they might not do what you ask at all, just lie to you or pocket the money and run. And one of the things that will make them disloyal is - micromanagement. Your advisors, based on their own motivations and abilities, will present three or more options of their own choosing that they propose to do as projects each turn. You can order a write-in, but you are encouraged to choose from among their proposals, because a write-in implies you don't trust their judgment in their field of expertise.<br/>
<br/>
So now it's time to see how you do when things are out of your hands and you're dependent on unknown NPCs. Will you select for competence first, or loyalty? Will you leave your advisors to get up to mischief, or look over their shoulders constantly? Will you try to buy friendship with gold, or will that just invite greed and corruption? Is a little nepotism and embezzlement an acceptable price to pay for an otherwise skilled councilor?<br/>
</i><br/>
Traditionally, there are six advisors in an Elector Count's privy council, each serving a very different role, but all functioning as the Count's hands in some important domain. Most of these positions start out having been filled outside your control. Short of outright treason, it is very hard to remove any of your advisors, as the others will view this as a threat to <i>their</i> position and power too. But you get to ensure that at least one person starts out loyal to you and not entirely incompetent. Choose the position you have been so fortunate as to be able to influence initially.<br/>
<br/>
[ ] Martial: The Marshal is in charge of military matters, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. Having a rogue Marshal could mean the decline of your entire army, crime waves and rampant smuggling, the invasion of your province from without, or a coup from within if the Marshal gets ambitious and wins the loyalty of your troops, something he's well placed to do.<br/>
<br/>
[ ] Diplomacy: The Chancellor is responsible for contact both within and without, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. Having a rogue Chancellor could leave you isolated from everyone from the Emperor to the peasantry. Worse, the Chancellor's silver tongue makes them the greatest risk for suborning other members of your Privy Council too.<br/>
<br/>
[❌] Stewardship: The Steward is responsible for taxes and the economy, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. A trustworthy Steward means you can hire replacements for any failures, and if you can't buy friendship, well, you can least rent it. But a rogue Steward will fill their pockets at the expense of your treasury, leaving you unable to do important things like pay soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
[ ] Intrigue: The Spymaster is the master of soft power in the realm, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. Having a rogue Spymaster means having little idea what plots and plans are going at best, if your Spymaster is merely idle or incompetent. At worst, the Spymaster may start actively plotting against you.<br/>
<br/>
[] Faith: The Chaplain is responsible for the souls of an entire province, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. Where the other advisors can merely steal from you or hurt you, a rogue Chaplain might see you excommunicated, the memory of your name erased, or your people fallen to Chaos.<br/>
<br/>
[] Learning: The most nebulous of all the roles, this role is usually filled based on the Elector Count's desires and prejudices, making it the most important position to fill with a trustworthy subordinate. This is the post of court wizards and witch hunters, Leonardo da Miragliano and other geniuses and madmen, innovators and reformers with the greatest amount of leeway for grand and unusual projects. A skilled and loyal Philosopher (title varies) might catapult your entire province to greatness; a rogue one might blow up your castle and burn down your city, on accident or on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in what province have you come into power?<br/>
<br/>
<i>(Province vote elided because it would be too short on interesting content and too much copypasta of the <a class="link link--internal" href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/9987149/">actual OP</a>. If this post seems incongruous with the other Elector Count apocrypha, it's because "Part 1" was written first as a one-off joke and this OP came later with more knowledge.)</i></div>
