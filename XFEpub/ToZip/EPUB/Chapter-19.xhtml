Vote closed. Stirland and Witch Hunter were clear winners.<br/>
<br/>
Elector Count of Stirland. A great and powerful position, enviable in theory. But in practice, the previous dynasty of Haupt-Anderssen was cursed with terrible ill-fortune until they died out of seemingly natural causes, ill-fortune above and beyond even what one might expect of having to live next to Sylvania.<br/>
You are Abelhelm van Hel, Witch Hunter, (yes, <i>those</i> van Hels) recently  returned to Stirland after rooting out a small army of Strigoi who had ensconced themselves under Talabheim. With the previous Count dead, you expected to have no official assignments for a while but a lot of work to do in fending off vampires who might attempt to take advantage of the province's turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
You were half right. Against all odds, you've been named the new Elector Count. Perhaps you were the compromise candidate. Perhaps the Electors thought someone unrelated to the Haupt-Anderssen dynasty might change the province's fortunes. Or perhaps they, too, thought vampire hunting would be a priority task. But regardless of the reason, you've been thrust into a position of great responsibility, and you have neither the professional experience nor the hours in the day to handle it all yourself. You're going to need help. Start by appointing a Privy Council. Traditionally, one such consists of six trusted individuals.<br/>
<br/>
You have some possible candidates presenting themselves for immediate appointment, or in some cases presented to you, but the downside is that you know little about them. (Mechanically, each candidate is generated with 4d6 drop lowest, then I subtract 1d6 to show you a lower bound for their stat. So if someone is listed with 9+, their true value is between 10 and 15. Also, only one trait is shown, regardless of how many the character has.)<br/>
<br/>
You can delay appointing to certain positions in order to find more candidates and find out more about the candidates for that position, but that comes with the obvious drawback that you will have no one overseeing that field during the first turn. You will be able to fire and replace advisors later, but if you do this too frequently or without cause, they may begin to mistrust you.<br/>
<br/>
Martial: The Marshal is in charge of military matters, second in command to the Elector Count themselves. It is a position of great power, but also one of danger and responsibility.<br/>

[ ] Anton II Kiesinger: Chancellor to the previous Count and younger son of a petty noble. Young, Diplomacy 8+<br/>
[ ] Journeywoman Kresge: an Imperial Pyromancer. Superstitious, Diplomacy 5+<br/>

[ ] Journeyman Eichhorn: an Imperial Amber Shaman. Paranoid, Stewardship 7+<br/>

[ ] Journeywoman Weber: an Imperial Shadowmancer. Brave, Intrigue 9+<br/>
[ ] Mysterious Notes: You have found unsigned slips of paper in your room claiming to be from your spymaster, telling you where to leave instructions and responses. ???, Intrigue ???+<br/>
[ ] Abd al Hakim: a migrant from the far land of Araby. Eunuch, Intrigue 10+<br/>

[ ] Delay Faith appointment<br/>
<br/>
Learning: The most nebulous of all the roles, this role is usually filled based on the Elector Count's desires and prejudices. The realm of madmen and geniuses, wizards and witch hunters, all seeking new ways to build and to destroy.<br/>
[ ] Herr Schultz: a member of the Guild of Stonemasons and Architects. Organized, Learning 11+<br/>
[ ] Frau Binger: an independent geographer and historian. Eidetic Memory, Learning 10+<br/>

			Hm. The martial options are mediocre, but we can cover for that. The diplomacy options are worse, which is probably going to suck as we selected Witch Hunter background and won't have much diplomacy ourselves. At least the other categories look pretty good - we can reasonably expect revealed values of 13-14.

			I'm torn. Part of me says that Spymaster is the position where we absolutely need someone both competent and trustworthy so we don't get shanked, meaning we should delay to find out more. OTOH, Spymaster is probably also the position we need to fill the fastest because not having one will also get us shanked. Especially with those options. A mage, a foreigner, and someone who hasn't even shown themselves?

			I suddenly feel a lot more sympathetic to nepotism looking at this post, surely our Count has got to have some kind of personal acquaintance or family member that has 10+ stat and is known to be trustworthy. I mean, Diplomacy has bad numbers, but it's Stewardship that really concerns me. Choice between "your advisor has affairs", "your advisor is a thug" and "your advisor is a paranoid wizard"? Or can't we hire, well, some generic boring clerk who's just good at numbers?
