A Black Crusade.<br/>
<br/>
It is undeniable now. Reports drift in from across the warp, astropaths screaming as blood drips in rivulets from suddenly empty sockets, their eyes having been flash vaporized by the sheer strength of the psychic messages burning their way out from the Eye of Terror. All across the Imperium, those that can hear the message, do. From Cadia, these messages come, no doubt greatly straining what astropaths and other various psykers are present there in order to send them, but be sent they must.<br/>
<br/>
Great blackened fleets have begun to flow out of the Eye of Terror, their hulls etched with the blasphemous symbols of the Dark Gods of Chaos. The element of surprise, somehow lost between now and the past few years, did nothing to stop the unending hatred of Abbadon the Despoiler. Ships almost unending swarmed out and fell upon the surrounding sectors of the Eye of Terror, either unaffected or uncaring of the deadly warp currents spewing out from that horrific realm. As of this very moment, every single member of the Astartes Praeses are under assault or participating in counterattacks as whole battlegroups are shifted out of year, and in a few cases even decade long campaigns in order to respond to this. The worlds and sectors left behind already groan under the many predations of the Imperium’s foes but this surge of Chaos cannot be given anything less than the Imperium’s best.<br/>
<br/>
For this is the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade, and should the Imperium falter, the devastation and horror that could come to pass in the aftermath are incalculable. But there is some small advantages to the Imperium in this fight. A sudden tremendous reveal of secretly stockpiled weapons and supplies on Cadia – already under heavy assault – by the heroic then Lord General Creed and the advance of an entire battlefleet from just outside the Cadia system blunted the initial assaults of Chaos though surrounding systems have quickly left Cadia surrounded. But that may not be enough, for just after this reveal the now eternally damned and blasphemous Volscani Cataphracts regiment of the Imperial Guard managed to slay much of the Cadian Interior Guard General Staff upon their recall to the world. Lord General Creed, then promoted to Lord Castellan, has taken complete command and battles even now a desperate fight. Abbadon’s fleets have cut off Cadia almost entirely and only the most powerful fleets could have a hope of penetrating the blockade of the world by Chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Yet that is not all, for it could never be so in the dawn of the 42<span style="vertical-align:super">nd​</span> Millennium.<br/>
<br/>
The 3<span style="vertical-align:super">rd​</span> War for Armageddon grows ever more intense as impending reinforcements are redirected to the 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade. Those already present in system have to make due to what courage and defiance they can muster after the arrival of three different Space Hulks which immediately proceeded to crash themselves against the surface and outpoured three separate greenskin forces each of which could have been considered a WAAAGH! in and of themselves had they been anywhere else. Two more Hives have fallen, though there are whispers in the warp of strange black armored space marines with coronas of flame appearing from the shadows and unleashing tremendous firepower before disappearing before one’s very eyes. Each time these apparitions appear the ork assaults falter giving precious time to the defenders to rebuild their defenses and regroup.<br/>
<br/>
More tyranids have been sighted in the Ultima Segmentum, but few deign to be concerned for several of these Hive Fleets given that they are rather interestingly going after the borders of the Tau Empire facing the Eastern Fringe, worlds that the Imperium has as of yet not assaulted even once. That is not to say that all are as such, for the tyranids do not discriminate. Several entire fleets of the tyranids appear to be drifting in the direction of the notorious Octarius War which began a short time ago though luckily plenty of orks appear to be heading there all the time as well. More considering tacticians are not nearly as pleased about the fact that should the tyranids actually manage to <i>win</i> said conflicts they are involved in the resulting biomass could result in two different gargantuan Hive Fleets the likes of which have not been seen since Behemoth was defeated.<br/>
<br/>
Such things and more, all across the galaxy, are ongoing even as ships within Subsector Aurelia shift and move. Your Blood Ravens march out, their heads held high, to finally put an end to your foes by bolter and boot. On Meridian, what forces are present scatter across the hives and their innards to chase down every hint of traitor and xeno they can. Against the heavily battered Imperial Guard and PDF of Meridian such entities might have found success but against the Angels of Death they are simply outmatched. In a curious echo of the infamous Commander Aramus’s tactics during the previous Aurelian Crusades tiny groups of Blood Ravens are sent to priority missions to perform small yet vital operations that break down their numerically superior foes advantages down unto nothing. Manufactorums are recaptured, communication arrays repaired, and shrines repaired.<br/>
<br/>
Of additional note is Captain Cyrus surprisingly moving from the orbiting flagship of the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company to ensure your numerous aspirants are blooded, and so uses Meridian as a crucible to bring about the survivors to his very exacting standards. Many die, but they do so in the service of the Emperor. Those that remain, on the other hand, achieved a gruff nod and grunt from the taciturn former Scout Sergeant. They are no longer aspirants, but actual neophytes. With this comes the opportunity<br/>
<br/>
With the aspirants, Cyrus himself took to the field alongside Captain Tarkus, and with that matters quickly came to a close. Against the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> and 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Companies, and the heroes within, what scattered remnants of the rebels of Meridian, the traitorous Guard who had fallen to Chaos, minor tyranid and ork infestations remained have all been put to the flame. Good riddance, glory to the Emperor. Of course, no victory comes without cost, and that remains true even now. Though no more deaths amongst full battle brothers occurred, some were indeed injured by a surviving Lictor tyranid that required a full squad to put down.<br/>
<br/>
Of these new neophytes, the implantation of the unique Blood Raven gene-seed has once again proved itself unlike its more mundane peers amongst other Chapters in the Imperium. Two of the neophytes have begun to display psyker abilities after their initial surgeries were complete. While strange, this is not entirely uncommon for the Chapter and frankly given how heavily the Blood Ravens rely on its Librarium it is a good thing indeed. Still, not all of the aspirants – veterans of Meridian regardless – survived the process.<br/>

<br/>
As for Calderis, you will brook no more issue with one of your most vital of worlds. Tarantula Sentry Guns – those you possess – are placed in strategic locations all over Argus Settlement while the Thunderhawks fly out and perform near constant bombing runs against the enemy. With the technologically disadvantaged feral orks being all that remain and the tyranid infestation unled by any truly notable synapse creatures your aerial assets fly with impunity. With prejudice, all forces on Calderis commit to the total eradication of the orks and tyranids. While normally allowing such things in small amounts is expected in order to keep Calderis potentials strong and mighty the constant near total destruction of your increasingly few Recruiting Worlds means that at least for some time Calderis simply <i>must</i> be allowed to recover its population to a viable extent.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you must also see to it that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company is led well. You are the Chapter Master, and cannot expect to always be there in order to provide guidance. As such, after a conference with your advisors, promote young Crixus as the Captain of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company. Problems almost immediately arise given his lack of veteran status and the relative fact that he is unknown to many in the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company but under your steely gaze complaints are put aside…publically at least. Brother Sicarius is visibly disappointed at being passed over for leadership of his company but he wrestles such inside of himself and provides the most excellent service regardless. Brother Antal seems to have no feelings much in one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the now Captain Crixus takes to command with a natural spark which hopefully lends <i>some</i> credence to your decision. There are a few notable instances of general disregard and disrespect being levied in his direction but the assault marine simply ignores such. So long as his commands are followed and objectives are achieved, he confides in you, he could care less about how century long veteran space marines perform the equivalent of a mere mortal rolling their eyes whenever he passes by. Both of the entombed brethren of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company are deployed with relative effectiveness, as are air assets, and by the end of it the orks have been pushed farther back from the settlements of humanity than they ever have been before. The tyranids, on other hand, are destroyed utterly with yourself and Apollo personally deploying once it became evident that the tyranids in some feral desperation had thrown much of their biomass into the generation of a carnifex.<br/>
<br/>
It fell beneath your hammer all the same.<br/>
<br/>
Still, work must be done to ensure that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company consistently listens to their comparatively untested Captain rather than just when you stand behind him. But that is a matter for another time. With Calderis finally secured, you can turn inward for a time. Your orders are given out and the forges of the Chapter are set to working for the first time since the death of Kyras. Martellus spends almost all of your available resources to fully repair the vital Implantation Chambers of the Omnia Arcanum, which he does so with alacrity with all available apothecaries assisting him in this duty. The fact that he completes his work so quickly is good indeed, in the future these premium facilities should aid in preventing mistakes with the implantation process and also allow you to make use of emergency measures regarding what gene-seed you do have.<br/>

In the meantime, you forge ahead in your retraining, unwilling to allow yourself to remain a barely functioning marine, and so spend quite a lot of time in the cages alongside Apollo. You have heard of the Iron Hand’s battle cry, “The Flesh Is Weak,” but your bionics are hardly proving much better. Lifesaving to be sure but you must strain and push them for everything they are worth. To the untrained mind you would not seem to be making much progress at all, but you know otherwise. You are dragging your body back to the state it was before Kyras’s blow inch by inch. In this case, you did quite well indeed.<br/>

You also go through the effort of contacting the Deathwatch. While it would be possible for you to order the recall of all your distant brethren, you know as well as they that the duty they perform is vital to the Imperium as a whole. It would be impossible for you in good conscience to demand they return before they are slated to, and instead choose to allow all those who are able to remain until the end of their vigils. All, save one. Tomb-Brother Palkair is the longest living Blood Raven in the whole of the Chapter, and his great wisdom, knowledge, and frankly his combat contributions would be greatly valued. Respect for his deeds remains high even now, which is not to be unexpected when one takes even a small perusal of his histories left in the annals. As such, you merely request that he return with a full report on the status of the Chapter, you do not demand.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><b>Persuading Palkair<br/>
(31/100</b>)​</div> <br/>
His response is depressingly short.<br/>
<br/>
“No.”<br/>
<br/>
That is all you receive from the eldest Blood Raven, though you conference with the Commander of Erioch reveals that an entire splinter fleet of tyranids has appeared near the Watch Fortress demanding the full attention of the nearby Deathwatch. You had hoped…but then again.<br/>
<br/>
Hope <i>is</i> the first step on the road to disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">=========================================<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Librarius Seeks<br/>
(89/100)</b><br/>​</div>“I would protest against the destruction of the Judgement of Carrion,” Martellus pipes up almost immediately after Cyrus finished speaking. “The secrets and archaeotech it possesses cannot be dismissed so easily.”<br/>
<br/>
“We walked it’s paths many a time before, but each time we escaped with as few casualties as we did was nothing more than a miracle Martellus, and with Aramus gone…” Tarkus rubs his chin slightly as the leadership of the Chapter gazes at the floating 3D pictograph of the ominous hulk.<br/>
<br/>
“We cannot trust that we will ever be able to make another viable excursion. It is still full of tyranids, orks, and likely daemons as well,” Cyrus cuts his hand through the air to emphasize his point, “We do not have the strength to attempt it again. So long as it remains it is a clear and present threat to the Chapter.”<br/>
<br/>
“Justinius?” you murmur as you turn your gaze to the Chief Librarian.<br/>
<br/>
He is silent for a moment while Tarkus and Cyrus argue against Martellus, eyes flickering with psychic energies, before shaking his head.<br/>
<br/>
“The best of our Librarians have attempted to pierce the veil surrounding this hulk since the Chapter’s histories began, and none have succeeded. With the Chapter, and the system as it is, I do not think we can risk it. Even now tendrils of the warp gather over it.”<br/>
<br/>
“I have no readings on its engines functioning,” the sole Techmarine in the room points out, his voice agitated.<br/>
<br/>
“You wouldn’t,” Justinius waves a hand absentmindedly, his gaze still locked onto the slowly rotating image at the center of the table. “But I can <i>see</i>. The wretched touch of the Hive Mind, the blasphemous taint of the more common denizens of the warp…and a new and growing plague of <i>green</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
At that, all conversation ceases, and eyes flick to Justinius.<br/>
<br/>
“You have seen this, for certain?” Cyrus demands, hands tightening on the edge of the thick metal table as he stands and leans upon it.<br/>
<br/>
“It could be a particularly successful Nob, some orks rallying within, but I do not believe in such coincidences. Our erstwhile ork Kaptin has escaped to the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
His tone is deathly final.<br/>
<br/>
“Then it <i>must</i> be destroyed,” Cyrus sneered.<br/>
<br/>
“I…would be remiss to my teachings if I was happy about this, but we can’t risk a threat like Bluddflag taking over a hulk like the <i>Judgement</i>,” Martellus does not quite petulantly sigh, he is a space marine after all, but air does escape his mouth in a certain distinct fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Being trapped alone on Typhon did <i>not</i> do him many wonders.<br/>
<br/>
“It is not as if we possess the armament to do so at the moment, barring sustained bombardment from our ships.”<br/>
<br/>
“It would be better to speak to the Mechanicus about it, I’d say.”<br/>
<br/>
Your bionics wheeze slightly as you stand.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well. Return to your duties, I shall consider the matter further.”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Advisors All In Agreement: Termination of Space Hulk designated <i>Judgement of Carrion</i> is best course of action. Current Chapter Fleet not necessarily capable of destroying hulk in a timely fashion. Martellus advises speaking to Adeptus Mechanicus. <br/>

<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
========================================<br/>​</div>As information flows across the galaxy, so too does your own knowledge grow. Segmentum Obscurus is in relative anarchy, obviously due to the resurgent 13<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Black Crusade, of which the Korianis Sector is effectively only a part by way of bureaucracy. When it is said that the Korianis Sector is on the edge of Imperial Space, it is wholeheartedly meant. Space certainly extends outwards into further systems, and you are not quite at the galactic edge, but the Korianis Sector is certainly close. So far out on the frontier are you that there have been at least a half dozen disputes amongst the Administratum whether or not the Korianis Sector is in the Segmentum Obscurus or the Ultima Segmentum.<br/>
<br/>
It is here, however, in the Segmentum Obscurus where the planet Kronus still resides, where the still damnable Kaurava System sits. It is here that resides the destroyed remains of Caliban, Fenris, and more. Far to the north and east of you lie the Ghoul Stars, and to the west is the Eye of Terror. To the east and south excursions from the Tau continue to push out endlessly, and conflict amongst the orks remains a constant in the Imperium. At the moment, however, you simply must focus on the Korianis Sector that the Blood Ravens have called home for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Zerann 52X1, where you are shortly preparing to meet with, is the last great bastion of the Adeptus Mechanicus on this specific fringe of the Imperium, and with it carries a sizable personal fleet and defensive forces. They have long been friends of your Chapter though with the revelations surrounding Kyras slowly propagating how they regard you is uncertain. You cannot rely on your previous relationship simply resuming as if nothing had happened. It should be noted though that the Mechanicus has recently reclaimed territory as well within the sector.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Mechanicus, of course, you <i>do</i> possess one other group which are allies of the Chapter. The Order of the Lost Rosetta, a militant order of the Sisters of Battle. Allied with the Chapter before Kyras and now hopefully after, they are relatively typical to their kind. They have fought alongside the Blood Ravens before though you personally never had the honor but according to the histories they are stalwart companions and have a fervent and unending hatred of the xeno practically above the heretic – a result of being out on the edge of Imperial Space and having the main target <i>be</i> various xeno threats. They have complete and total dominion over the Ramona System, which is on the other ‘side’ of the Sector within Subsector Aralakh and as far as you know are still battling the various threats there. Of course…given that you recently came into direct conflict with the Sisters of Battle during the Kaurava Campaign and the reveal that much of the Chapter had fallen to Chaos...your relations with them may or may not be irreparably damaged. You will only know once you attempt contact with their Canoness.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of further threats within the Sector, there are foes aplenty. Kyra’s touch is evident here, refusing to grant aid to the many requests throughout the Sector against infestations of orks, hrud, and tyranids that came along with the splinter fleet that Aramus defeated a relatively short time ago. Kyras may have treated the Sector with the disdain and depravity of the traitor but you will <i>not</i>. There are many threats laying before you and you have little doubt that your aid would be appreciated against them. Hopefully doing so may restore <i>some</i> good will to the Blood Ravens in the Imperium. Some Chapters may treat the mortal folk with disdain but with the state that your brothers are all in you can’t afford to alienate the Imperium further.<br/>
<br/>
There is much work to be done, but you will not shirk it.<br/>
<br/>
For you are the Blood Ravens.<br/>
