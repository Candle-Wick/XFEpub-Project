Three of the tremendous <i>Or'es El'leath</i>-class carriers. Ten <i>Lar'shi'vre</i> Cruisers. A varied setting of escorts. It was a mighty fleet. One of the most powerful ever assembled. Or at least that was what the belief was amongst the rest of the Empire as they sent out their latest and most advanced vessels into what many were slowly realizing was a much darker universe than their wildest imaginings. Another of the worlds that had been claimed in the Third Sphere had gone quiet, silent, with only garbled transmissions being the only sign of their existence now. It was more than a little worrying, for while some might have been foolish enough to think that the with the Imperium distracted as it was with whatever else they were dealing with on the far side of the galaxy, there were yet plenty of more threats remaining to the Greater Good. As it was now, the ships of the Kor’vattra had been assembled both as a rescue force if possible and a retribution force if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
To the shock and horror of many of the newer members of the task force, the latter was clearly going to be absolutely and completely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
“Shas’O,” one of the Air Caste technicians spoke up, his voice trembling. “The scans are complete. There…there are no Tau life signs remaining on the planet.”<br/>
<br/>
Shadowsun did not strike him, though her lips split open in a near feral snarl as she growled, ripping the data slate out of the crewman’s hands to glare at it as if to somehow force the truth into something else. Only a moment did her fury last before she calmed herself, breathing deeply as she contemplated Puretide’s teachings and the words of the Ethereals before she departed on what was to be a mission to the technical farthest reaches of the Tau Empire. But that only made it worse, in part, as she slumped within her armor only enough for her own satisfaction but not so much that it could be detected from without. Silently, she padded forward to the edge of the bridge, towards the planet below.<br/>
<br/>
“None at all. And the damage to the colony’s infrastructure?”<br/>
<br/>
“Severe, Shas’O,” the crewman who had followed behind her answered, his voice almost a whisper. “I…”<br/>
<br/>
“Speak,” she looked at him out of the corner of her eye but kept herself facing the now lost colony world.<br/>
<br/>
“What could do this? To break through the defenses we developed, and so brutally?<br/>
<br/>
In truth, she had her suspicions. Energy readings. Scans of the damage dealt to the perimeter orbital defenses. The tracking of damage and fighting by the defenders as their attacks appeared before them. It had been a long time since facing such things, but her mind was crystal clear and her knowledge all-encompassing through the reports and information granted to her by Aun’Va of what she faced. Here and now, at the least, she faced no one. More likely than not, the world was lost to them in more ways than one, but there was only one way to find out.<br/>
<br/>
“Make ready. I shall lead a task force to the surface, but keep the ships in a defensive formation while I am gone.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">============================<br/>​</div>“Gauss weaponry,” she muttered as she ran a finger over the edges of one of the buildings where a great groove had been carved into it. “I knew it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Shas’O?” one of the Shas'ui Fire Warriors spoke, his head tilting slightly while the rest of his squad spread out to check through the buildings.<br/>
<br/>
“Necron, Shas’ui. A terrible alien scourge that the Empire has dealt with before. But where are the bodies? Necron usually leave bodies…,” she trailed off.<br/>
<br/>
It was not, as she had worried, a world such as the lost Kronus or otherwise. A ‘Tomb World’ as she knew they were called. Instead, perhaps worse, all of the colonists who had been sent to this world were gone. For sure, there were a few bodies here and there, mangled and their flesh stripped from them by the disgusting terror troops creatively named ‘flayed ones’ by the monstrous mechanical aliens, but the vast majority were simply…gone. The reasoning behind this, the cause, the effect, she could not yet see these things, but far more than that was the worry that it might not be the first of them. The Empire had just barely finished securing itself against the Imperium it could not afford to be struck in its precarious position by the necron.<br/>
<br/>
It was simple, then. She would have to eradicate any and all necron that darkened the borders of the Empire. For the Greater Good. In the meantime, the planet would be re-settled, and <i>this</i> time she would brook no argument in her devising of its defenses.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================<br/>​</div>“Ten thousand warriors to you, then, Traveler,” the Stormlord nodded slowly in the direction of his lesser Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Anrakyr said nothing, and indeed did not need to. The rapid exchange of command protocols was all that was required, and then the Traveler stepped away as his newest additions to his waiting fleet above shifted in lockstep forward. They were mindless, by now, their souls and minds long extinguished by the biotransference and the Great Sleep, but Anrakyr had needed soldiers and Imotekh had been willing to give them if only for a price. The Stormlord turned away and phased in turn, teleporting deep within his Crownworld, though a part of him kept his eye on the departing Anrakyr. He always needed to watch, to ensure and keep a careful eye on any and all around him. Not just on his fellow necron, but on the vile creatures which infested his galaxy as well.<br/>
<br/>
“Cryptek,” he spoke though both he and Szeras both knew that their very natures made it impossible to miss his arrival.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, protocols required certain etiquette. Some, like the Mother of Oblivion, had forgotten that. But not he. Never the Stormlord.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, yes what is it,” the Cryptek Lord muttered, barely sparing a glance in the direction of the one who was his patron. “I’m busy!”<br/>
<br/>
“How goes your work in examining the creatures,” Imotekh jerked his metal chin in the direction of the stasis-frozen Tau.<br/>
<br/>
Szeras went through the effort of exuding an audible sigh from his frame before slamming his tools back onto the ground and turning about to reveal his gore slaked chassis.<br/>
<br/>
“I have barely begun, they just <i>arrived</i>! I have but vivisected only a hundred of them!”<br/>
<br/>
“And you have <i>nothing</i> else to report?” the Stormlord would have raised an eyebrow had he the face for it, but his voice sufficed in this.<br/>
<br/>
“Bah!” the master of biotransference grunted, waving his hands before turning back to the table and dragging up the corpse of some water caste or another, her mouth still open in pain and horror, “Yes. Something…something. Their souls, their interaction with the warp, it is <i>dulled</i>. Is there potential there? Perhaps.  Like warriors, if,” he pinched his fingers together until they were almost touching, “Slightly more. But the dullness….yes. It could work. Perhaps. I shall invent a machine to test it!”<br/>
<br/>
Imotekh did not reply, only teleporting elsewhere on his world and leaving the cryptek to his work. For he had gambled ten thousand of his warriors to the Traveler in exchange for those tens of thousands of Tau. If the effort failed, it would be regrettable, but unfortunately unlike in war he could not precisely predict or plan around the works going on in the depths of the tomb world. It was all experimentation, random results, and such things. It was more frustrating than many things that he had faced before now since his awakening, but not nearly the worst thing. Yet more tendrils of the ‘tyranids’ were coming through his territories, a small orkish WAAAAGH!!! was readying itself to invade, and far more powers beyond that threatened his domain.<br/>
<br/>
But soon.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
He might not have to worry about how to truly replenish his ranks ever again.</div>
