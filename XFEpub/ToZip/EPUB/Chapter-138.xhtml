    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 10</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Strike against Clan Eshin
- [*] ESHIN: Attempt to assassinate their Sorcerer.



If Eshin win, you reason, they will probably leave. All well and good. But though Eshin might not seek to make Eight Peaks theirs, other factions in the Under-Empire will almost certianly seek to fill what they see as a void, and they will be a greater threat for the information that Eshin might provide to them. So despite the immediate threat that Mors might present if they win and try to return to the Trench, it's a lesser evil than Eshin arming the entire Under-Empire with what they might know of the Karak and its inhabitants. So you leave the Cavern of Stars once more to slip into Karag Yar, this time to hunt a being with a skillset very similar to your own.

[State of the Battlefield, Eshin: 87.]
[State of the Battlefield, Mors: 1.]
[State of the Battlefield, Dragon: 50.]
[Hunting and being hunted: Intrigue, 96+22+5(Tactics: Skaven)+10(Windsage)=133 vs 68+???-10(Unaware)=???.]

You had estimated perhaps an hour left in this final desperate duel, but either you erred greatly or things went sideways in an incredible fashion the moment you took your eyes off the Skaven, because the remains of what looks like at least half of the Albino Stormvermin battalion are scattered throughout about a quarter of the Under-Karag, some half-eaten and some still sizzling as Eshin poisons burn their way through flesh. Some of those poisons are chemical in nature, while some have already begun to break down into the Dhar they were created from. Through this grim spoor you track your quarry, cloaked in as little Ulgu as possible to keep your Magesight clear. The Eshin blend of Dhar and Ulgu leaves a distinct tang in the air, but between Dhar dissolving and Ulgu dissipating it's hard to extract more information than 'he was here'. Hard, but not impossible. Not for you.

Through a zig-zagging path through the smallest of passages, some so narrow you have to fall back on the intangibility of Substance of Shadow to follow, the Sorcerer split from the rest of the Eshin right on the cusp of victory, which sets your suspicions ablaze.

[Gaining on your target: Intrigue, 82+22+5(Tactics: Skaven)+10(Windsage)=119.]

With Aethyric Armour stealing away your fatigue you make your way through the Karag at speed without jeopardizing your stealth, sling-shotting your way around skirmishes so that the sounds of desperate combat mask your footfalls. Whatever the Sorcerer is up to, you want to know as much as you can as soon as you can. Perhaps this is something you'd need to strike early to prevent, perhaps you'd be best served by letting it play out. Most likely it will be some murky blend of the two. You make good time and it seems like the Sorcerer got held up by a battle that he decisively ended, and by the time the Sorcerer arrives at what appears to be his destination you're so close that you can practically taste the ambient Dhar clinging to him. You enter the cavern mere seconds after him and settle into a niche in the wall, your form camouflaged, invisible and intangible on the assumption that there's no such thing as too many precautions against Eshin, and let your Magesight do the work while your mundane eyes adapt to the darkness.

Flanked by a pair of Stormvermin is a robed Skaven that stands taller than either of his bodyguards, his body so festooned with warpstone jewellery that he shines like a befouled lighthouse to your Magesight, and it is to he that the Sorcerer approaches, chittering what seems like a greeting with false deference, his mind roiling with the anticipation of battle, and you curse your inability to understand spoken Queekish. A document of some sort is handed over, and the robed Skaven produces what looks like a glass bead containing a sphere of unrefined warpstone, spilling green light over the document and illuminating his form, and emblazoned upon his robe in golden thread is the thirteen-pointed wheel symbol of the Council of Thirteen.

Unable to understand their conversation, you instead pick apart their mental states. The Sorcerer is simple enough, mostly Ulgu with a little Aqshy as he savours the moment before an unexpected attack. The other Skaven is more focused, Chamon buzzing in his mind as he analyzes the document and barks questions at the Sorcerer, but underneath that is a touch of rancid divinity. His soul bears the marks of what must be the Horned Rat, and a tendril of it is rooted deep within his mind. The two bodyguards are mentally barely there, but in a way that suggests discipline instead of stupidity, as stupid Skaven would be confused by the conversation rather than very carefully ignoring it. So many unknowns. What is the agent's role here? What would best serve the Karak? Should the Sorcerer still die? Should this apparent agent of the Council die? Should you abort the entire attempt since Mors seem on the verge of extinction, or should you do your best to allow them to seize victory from the jaws of defeat?

- [ ] Watch the attack play out, then leave.
[ ] Other (write in)


- I normally avoid re-litigation, but there's enough new facts on the board that it's a lesser evil compared to locking you in to a decision you made earlier. Narrative pacing and player agency were at cross-purposes and I chose the latter. If you disagree with the choice I have made, I request that you do not post that disagreement.
- There will be a two hour voting moratorium.
- Unless 'both must die' is chosen, Mathilde will attempt to leave whoever is not her target alive, but will not risk her life to do so if they press an attack.
