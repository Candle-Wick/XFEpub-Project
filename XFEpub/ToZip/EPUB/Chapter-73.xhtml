    <h2>Interlude - The Taking of Und-Uzgar</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[X] You could go up there alone, Skywalk atop the battlements, then open the door to let forces in.
- [X] Codrin's miscellaneous forces.



With no lookouts visible on the walls, and the sun burning hot and bright above you, you feel fairly confident that if there is a garrison, they're tucked away in the 'keep' of the watchtower, burrowed into the mountainside. You cloak yourself in concealing magics and begin your way up the switchback trail, with a selected group of Codrin's glory-seekers standing ready at the bottom - and, at his insistence, Maximilian, who assures you that he'll remain at range. When you go over the wall, they'll begin making their way with as much stealth as several hundred men can up the trail, and if you give the signal they and all the others will throw stealth to the wind and charge up with all speed. It's a gamble, but you feel it's less so than the rangers climbing the cliff face, and will result in less attrition than smashing the door down.

Skywalk only comes in handy rarely, but on those few occasions it is a complete gamechanger. When you approach the base of the walls, you shape Ulgu and step onto thin air, picturing a rising slope that takes you onto the battlements, and in seconds you reach the top of a wall twice your height. You pause at the top for a moment, scanning the courtyard within for any signs of life, but the closest you see is the scattered refuse from what you assume is the former greenskin inhabitants. Blood is splattered here and there, and no bodies, and judging from the smeared blood they were dragged into the mountain keep. Far below, the select few begin making their way up the trail, and though you can see them moving far below you can't yet hear them, which is reassuring. Without further ado, you drop down into the courtyard and turn to examine the inside of the gateway - crudely-crafted wood that only roughly resembles an oversized pair of doors, shaped by the hands of greenskins rather than Dwarves, and hung haphazardly upon hinges that have suffered three thousand years of neglect. The entire height where the two doors meet is festooned with dozens of crude protuberances to hold objects to bar the doors - halfway up is the main one, a solid bar of wood as big as you are, but also contributing to the task are spears, rusted swords, metal bars and bones. This could be a problem.

Acting with care rather than haste, you remove the smaller bars and set them aside as silently as possible, but the central bar concerns you - it's too large to be at all sure of shifting it silently. You run through possible solutions in your mind. Burning Shadows creates the effects of acid upon living targets rather than actual acid, so it can't be used to burn through the bar. Substance of Shadow would render the bar insubstantial to you, but it would continue to physically affect the doors and thus keep them closed. Fire would take quite some time to burn through the bar or the door, and the crackling of the flames might alert any enemies within the keep. You examine the hinges, and they certainly seem to be showing signs of age, but they are of the original structure - good dwarven steel - and if three thousand years of holding up greenskin-built doors haven't budged them you don't like your own chances. You can hear the men below approaching, though only because you're listening for it, and you doubt anyone inside could hear them - yet.

You turn and creep up to the door into the mountain. There's no keyhole, but there might be a bar on the inside. You gather Ulgu and cast Magic Lock upon the door, and feel the spell sink into the wood - though you can't tell if it found a bar within to act upon. If you're lucky, that will force anyone inside to physically batter the door down to get out; if you're not lucky, you've wasted a few precious seconds. You spend a precious second pressing your ear against the door, but all you can hear is your own pulse pounding in your ears. You turn back to the gateway and consider your options.

[ ] Maximilian is coming with the first wave of glory-seekers. Pull him up over the wall and have him use Stoke The Forge to burn through the bar with supernaturally hot flames.
[ ] You didn't spend all this effort getting into shape for nothing. Physically lift the bar up and out. You probably will manage to lift it, but you might not be able to drop it again quietly.
[ ] You didn't spend all this effort getting into shape for nothing. Physically lift the bar up and out, then use Substance of Shadow to silence the drop.
[ ] It's far beyond the size of anything you've tried this with, but you might be able to stretch your limits. Cast Substance Of Shadow on one of the doors so the men can simply walk through.
[ ] Fall back on one of the other plans:
- [ ] Rangers climb the outer walls.
- [ ] The glory-seekers batter down the door.
[ ] Other (write in)

- With the sun overhead, the gateway is in shadow. With Substance of Shadow, you would be invulnerable unless and until you were illuminated or an enemy has a magic weapon.
- Substance of Shadow has an unusual affect on inanimate objects - they continue to act upon anything they're already acting upon, but become insubstantial to people.
- Using Substance of Shadow to silence the drop means casting one of the most complicated spells you know under far from ideal conditions.
- You've prearranged silent signals with the leaders below for falling back on the other plans.
