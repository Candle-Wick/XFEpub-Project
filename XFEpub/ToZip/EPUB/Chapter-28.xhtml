<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">[X]Rocks Fall, Orks Die<br/>
-[X] Scout out for locations near Area F that have large number of cliffs and/or relatively unstable ground.<br/>
(We need this to be nearby position F. Trying to bait the Warboss across most of the continent is a fool's errand)<br/>
-[X] Trap said location with explosives. Generate Rockslides, collapse cliff faces, split the ground beneath the Gargant's feet... whatever is applicable to the chosen location.<br/>
--[X]To that end, if we could gain the assistance of the Mechanicus in excavating a pit or trench that the Gargant could fall into, that would be another level of immobilization.<br/>
-[X] Bait the Warboss into the trapped location. The old standby of insulting the size of his choppa and casting aspersions upon the 'ardness of the Warboss and his boyz should do. Refer to Cyrus for additional inspiration and advice, his centuries of experience love of unconventional tactics means he should have some unique insights to offer. If all else fails, perhaps the Warboss could be lured by our Stronos Pattern Razorback? it is particularly rare &amp; shiny.<br/>
--[X]Do the trap thing.<br/>
-[X] Board the Gargant with 5th Company and Characters.<br/>
--[X]Sabotage the reactor, then retreat ASAP.<br/>
-[X]All Space Marine armored vehicles that aren't part of the baiting force are to support allied forces. Thunderhawks to provide fire support as well, after they are done deploying the boarding team.<br/>
<br/>
My ideas for the Scrying and 85th Vendoland are below.<br/>
<br/>
-[X] 1 Use ONLY: Use the powers of the Librarians to<br/>
--[X] Find where the reactor is in the Gargant and plot the best route for the Fifth Company.<br/>
-[X]Speak to Magos Verillian about our plan, see if we can get assistance with trapping the Gargant as described above, and with the fight itself, as described below.<br/>
--[X] The boarding Asartes will need cover, that Orkish reinforcements from outside the Gargant don't swarm inside and bring down the Blood Ravens through sheer weight of numbers. Ambushes once the trap is triggered, disguised trenches, attacking from the top of cliffs are all potentials. Obviously a valley of some sort would funnel Orkish reinforcements into a killing ground, but we may not be so lucky as to find a useful one. Either way, our full complement of Tarantula Guns will be available.<br/>
<br/>
-[X] Issue Orders to the 85th Vendoland<br/>
--[X]If the Mechanicus cannot assist us in removing Greenskin reinforcements, ask Col. Merrick to do so instead. The same rules of assistance apply.</div>

The mountains that the orks took up residence in were formerly quite stable indeed. Yet all the time that they have been here with their stomping machines, their explosions, and the inescapable and utterly unexplainable works of orkish technology doing whatever it wished, the same could not be said now. Relentless warfare has a way of damaging the landscape beyond what is visible to the naked eye and the churning destructive nature of orks mean that inevitably all places that they land upon like those mountains are damaged in one way or another. There turned out to be a valley, not a particularly massive one but large enough for your purposes, with pure white stone cliffs that had to have been crafted by the nature of this world for nearly unfathomable amounts of time.<br/>
<br/>
It also happened to be the testing ground for orks wishing to fire a large number of explosives whenever they got bored. For those orks who were not able to march out or were at least told to not march out towards the rest of the fighting for whatever reason that the Warboss could think up for himself this was quite often indeed. Better is that it is somewhat nearby the main camp for ease of orks wishing to go blow off some steam. There are other locations of course but this is amongst the best that Cyrus and his scouts could find after creeping about for several days as the orks worked themselves into a new frenzy once the news of their losses to the north.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Mechanicus, Magos Verillian informs you that while they do possess some digging technologies they can’t provide any to you for the operation…<i>after</i> Cyrus has already done his duty. The Magos was far too busy with his own preparations to actually answer you in a timely fashion and though you must swallow your irritation at the tech-priest you cannot deny that the attack which begins shortly after he closes communications with you is quite impressive indeed. From the skies they push forward and land skitarii legions, while tanks rumble forth and attract the attention of the orks in great numbers as they sense the potential for a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Though you respect their dedication and skill with machines, it is no less curious for you to watch as they fly in troops, push forward, surround, and then dig in around each and every site containing a fallen knight. In more than one case this means that they stake their claims upon the rockslides which crushed them. Besides that however, you let them have the fight they so desire. If a few thousand skitarri are destroyed because of their mad rush to protect the knight bodies then so be it. They are more machine than man and if the Mechanicus wishes they could send forth tens of thousands to replace them, grown from vats and grafted with technology to make a mere guardsman weep.<br/>
<br/>
You are to take on the deadliest target – the Gargant. Damaged it may be but the damned machine is so entirely full of guns that they can still fire some of them at the approaching Mechanicus lines. With a series of great plumes do the entire compliment of your tarantula guns slam down onto the valley walls and on the grounds behind them, with Cyrus and the rest of his company joined by Colonel Merrick’s rapidly redeployed troops alongside and behind them. The knowledge that Cyrus is the one who is responsible for the Gargant’s latest predicament is more than enough to get orks running for a well prepared killing field – some of them even exiting the damaged Gargant to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Which is when you, Apollo, and the rest of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company such as it is are deployed on top of the rusted machine from the Thunderhawks. Orks boil out like maggots but are quickly cut down by bolter fire and a well placed hammer strike from Apollo – though there will be more. There has yet been no sign of the Warboss since his Gargant was struck down and partially buried beneath the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">========================================​</div> <br/>
“Epistolary,” you call out over coms, “Are you certain of the path laid out before us!?”<br/>
<br/>
“The ritual was clear,” Maphar responds calmly, “We are certain.”<br/>
<br/>
“Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
With a series of grenade blasts opening up the hatches further for you to descend, you enter the belly of the beast. It is a horrific mixture of gears, steam, piping, and badly constructed hallways filled with nonsense machines built with no purpose than greenskin insanity and the greenskins themselves. With flamer and bolter you carve out a path, following the arcane instructions of Maphar and the Codicier with him – a series of memorized lefts and rights that eventually guides you to what will truly reveal what you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
“That is,” Apollo grunts as he wrenched his hammer out of the caved in chest of the ork mek that had challenge him, “Rather what I expected.”<br/>
<br/>
A giant and badly drawn picture of a tube with yellow circles scrawled inside with obvious danger markings. It is, you know, the ork version of telling someone that the reactor is in the direction of the crudely painted arrow which is slapped beneath the picture of what they think a reactor looks like. Or perhaps just what they thought was a good artistic representation of it. You know better than to ponder on such things and instead elect to charge forward.<br/>
<br/>
The fighting grows only more intense from there, and you grit your teeth in fury as one of the marines of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company takes a series of slugs to the torso and falls without even a final cry to the Emperor. Slugs thrown from the combi-weapon of a massive ork with what appears to be a snarling engine attached to its back and a power klaw in the other hand.<br/>
<br/>
“Get outta me Gargant, ya beakies! Get out!”<br/>
<br/>
“I will face thee, ork,” Apollo cries out in turn, “Chapter Master, see to the explosives!”<br/>
<br/>
And you do. While Apollo duels the Big Mek, you work your way throughout the reactor chamber and its dozens of oddly placed walkways and entrances constantly trickling in greenskin reinforcements to place detonation packs everywhere you can. Another of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company falls but he rises soon after, heedless of the blood pouring out of his shoulder as he fires his bolter with only one hand. By the time you are done, Apollo has been swiped across the face and sent flying to land in front of you face first – but only by the dying flails of the Big Mek that the former captain of the honor guard had just barely defeated. A harder fight than you would have thought, but you cannot judge Apollo. It was an honorable fight for truth.<br/>
<br/>
There is little else to say after that. Your one dead and three wounded are pulled along with you, to reach the Thunderhawks above and waiting. More greenskins appear, and more die, all the while you finger the detonator for the reactor. Once you burst through the roof of the Gargant you can see that the Mechanicus is pushing even further into the greater basin where the roks landed at all, the battle swaying deeply towards the Omnissiah’s chosen in their fury. To the west, the killing ground that Cyrus prepared is carpeted with bodies in a heartening sight indeed.<br/>
<br/>
However.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the last of the marines were loaded onto the Thunderhawks, and you yourself were preparing to board, a great blast of gunfire came from behind you. With your own body you blocked most of the shots and kept more from entering the open and vulnerable holding bay of the vessel, which was thrown off by the shots and even began to lift off slightly. Around the Gargant, orks continued to swarm, but as you turned and faced your attacker you realized that they had also gathered in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
Warboss Sawskull, or so you would presume given the fact that an ugly contraption has been bolted onto his head with an attached spinning blade just near the forehead.<br/>
<br/>
“You…<i>you</i> bloody beakies, don’t you know not to mess with a boyz foight when ‘es getting goin’?!”<br/>
<br/>
He slams his power klaw against the metal of the Gargant once before pointing it towards you.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ze gonna kill you fer dat! And for messin’ up me poor Gargant!”<br/>
<br/>
“Not likely, ork.”<br/>
<br/>
[] Duel Warboss Sawskull openly, on top of his broken Gargant.<br/>
[] Leave on Thunderhawk, explode Gargant with what you planted and hopefully kill Sawskull that way.<br/>
