+<i>Let Your Fury Scour The Xeno Forevermore+</i></b><br/>​</div>“I have had enough of this place,” Gabriel said evenly. “It is time we left it.”<br/>
<br/>
“I could not agree more, Chapter Master,” Cyrus growled.<br/>
<br/>
The vox clicked as Gabriel activated the chapter-wide band, a minutely different tone to the noise that hypnotherapy ensured returned a rote reaction. Whether they were scout, tactical, or even dreadnought, all stiffened to attention. All knew that their Chapter Master was about to speak. He clambered his way atop a rather large pile of fallen rocks, his motion drawing attention as much as the vox click itself. As one, the combined Blood Ravens turned about to face him, their bodies anemically illuminated in the near silent darkness of the gutted Doom-Eater. Gabriel’s armor creaked as he lifted the crackling hammer high in the air.<br/>
<br/>
“Blood Ravens! You have fought well! For three weeks we have fought within the confines of this accursed construct! With our victory here, the Doom-Eater’s shields and weaponry has fallen silent forevermore! They can no longer hide from <i>their</i> doom! We advance to the launch bay, where we will hold position until the Fleet can return to us! Forward, brothers! May None Find Us Wanting!”<br/>
<br/>
Near the entire Chapter rose up, cheering and bellowing their war cries, all following after Gabriel after he leapt down and began stomping down the passageway at a punishing pace. As they continued forward, the sounds of orks nearby could be heard as well. After all, despite all of the fighting, the greenskins still had many more bodies to throw into the constant fights raging about the place. At first, on the way to the launch bay, it was a few ork mobs that found themselves torn apart by rapiers and heavy weapons before they could do more than fire their pistols in the air once or twice. Then slowly their numbers grew, drawn to the possibility of a better fight.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attentions During Withdrawal<br/>
6 vs. 75 vs. 88</b><br/>
<br/>
A dozen became hundreds. Hundreds became thousands. All rushing through the tunnels, an endless tide barely stoppered by the issues of their emergence.The Blood Ravens became crushed, even as they emerged into the launch bay, as a stone between twinned green fists. Already, a number of orks had been present in the bay. Worse, defensive positions sprouted out across the floors, walls, and ceiling. All were inhabited by howling orks and gretchin wielding typically oversized cannons and guns who began firing on all present. Two distinct groups of the orks, their banners and recently slathered paints marking their designations and loyalties to two different leaders, while the space marines formed a tight block between them all. Just as much ammo was expended towards rival warbands of orks as was towards the Blood Ravens, the ensuing melee insanely chaotic in its violence.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Actual Advance<br/>
96 vs. 72 vs. 43</b><br/>
<br/>
But the Blood Ravens refused to be stopped. Two techmarines found themselves chasing after Hannibal Palrun, barely finished with affixing replacement parts and patch repairs onto his armor, their already red armor growing darker with newly spilt crimson. The Chapter Master himself was an unshakable mountain that drove a canyon into the sea of green, leaving only corpses in his wake for other space marines to clamber over. Initiates banded together in their squads, firing with the fire-forged precision that only continual combat could draw out, each covering blind spots with every boom of their bolters and shotguns. The last of the explosives were thrown, the rapiers firing as they moved without daring to pause in their forward motion, the dreadnoughts simply bulling ahead and letting those behind them finish off those that survived contact with the half-dead within.<br/>
<br/>
Those who fell, wounds upon wounds finally demanding that a leg go out, found themselves picked up and carried without a single iota of momentum lost. Some found their bodies forcing them into suspended animation, frozen in pain yet carried to the center of the formation. Endless and near seamless cycling of the most wounded towards the protected center while those who endured remained on the outside. Where armor failed, flesh and bone would provide the shield. When the body began to falter, will pulled it upright once more. The Emperor’s Angels of Death bored their way through the mass defying them, smashing aside low walls of scrap, leaping atop ramshackle towers to slaughter the orks within, leaping high with jump packs and impacting down below on every knot of hardened resistance to the charge. Behind there was no end to the orks, but such were their numbers, such was their alien aggression, that the further the Blood Ravens got towards the towering slabs of metal which kept out the void, the less orks that bothered to go after them in favor of racing towards one another.<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel heaved the corpse of a mega-nob over, its head utterly obliterated by the strike from his hammer, yet before he could turn to do more he heard as did others on the command band the crackle of the vox.<br/>
<br/>
“This is Captain Hadrian Priscus on the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>. Any Blood Raven leadership, respond!”<br/>
<br/>
“This is Gabriel,” the Chapter Master responded immediately, turning so that the maelstrom of noise from the battle going on behind him was at least somewhat muted. “It is good to hear your voice, Hadrian. How fares the fleet?”<br/>
<br/>
The doughty Captain of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company audibly grumbled.<br/>
<br/>
“There were some casualties, but we have effected what repairs were needed for warp travel. The Doom-Eater’s primary propulsion has ceased completely and other energy signatures are near dead. I assume that was the Chapter’s doing?”<br/>
<br/>
Screaming, a quartet of massive nobs with rockets strapped to their backs leapt towards the Blood Ravens. The ensuing explosion as they were shot down mid-flight briefly drowned out Gabriel’s next words, forcing him to start over.<br/>
<br/>
“Correct. We require extraction by teleportarium, the shielding of this place will certainly not survive being exposed to the void. Marking our location now. Afterwards, commit Exterminatus.”<br/>
<br/>
“Understood, Chapter Master. We are already on the move.”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Holding Position<br/>
90 vs. 12 vs. 79</b><br/>
<br/>
Gabriel turned back to face the remaining leadership who happened to be nearby, though the Master of Sanctity was already back on the line, his crozius rising and falling constantly. Behind his punishing pace he spied the techmarines Calus and Daedal chasing after, frantically trying to patch the frankly horrific damage done to Hannibal’s armor. They did not seem to be having much luck getting him to slow down at all, but at least their own personal martial abilities made them effective if unorthodox guards for him. Elsewhere, Apollo continually ranged out beyond the battle line the Blood Ravens had forged over the bodies of the orks, breaking charges before they could even truly begin. The former champion of Kyras almost masochistically threw himself at foes in numbers that even Gabriel would contemplate challenging in such a manner. But the results were undeniable. As one of the greenskin hordes found itself beaten back and slowly choked off, the other slowly began to lumber its attentions towards the remaining foe. What they found, then, was death. Heavy bolters sang alongside lascannons, the rapiers firing constantly all the while. The Blood Ravens had gone as far as they could go, and had nowhere else to retreat to.<br/>
<br/>
Then, it happened. Priority signal had been given, of course, to the apothecaries and all signatures near them. The stink of tainted ozone joined with the snap and crack of lightning wreathing their frames. In an instant, they were gone. Then, steadily, like a wave, the advanced teleporariums upon the Blood Raven fleet did their work. This far out from the Astronomican it was a dangerous proposition to do so, but there was another light which guided them. Gabriel knew it well. In the long years of his life as a space marine, he had heard and felt its silver tones, and thus knew what the flickering pulsations were that sounded near similar. The Litany of Fury’s secret heart burned bright, and so Gabriel felt the twitches of a smile as he saw the absolute fury on the faces of the orks as they saw the Blood Ravens begin to disappear entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===============================================​</div> <br/>
An ork Warlord, twice as large as a dreadnought in frame, finally wrenched himself free from his moorings. Thousands of wires which once connected directly into his body ripped out at the same time, spilling blood on the ground in rivulets. Bones clicked as the old greenskin began to pick up speed, thundering forward to slam through the massive bastion doors which protected his inner sanctum, the reactor of his armor flooding his dozen heavy weapons with life. Advanced gravity tearing cannons on his shoulders whined as their internal mechanisms began to leak heat, while the three-barreled plasma gun on his left forearm glowed hot. His power klaw, larger than a space marine’s entire body, snapped open and closed while incendiaries began to bleed from specialized compartments in tandem with an aura of lightning over his entire body.<br/>
<br/>
Doom-Eater, the true one, roared with his flesh-throat for the first time in two decades as he threw himself into the fight against the dozen ork leaders who had come to challenge his leadership directly.<br/>
<br/>
Before he, along with the rest, was blanketed in the fire of Exterminatus weaponry. Perhaps Captain Hadrian was bit vindictive with his usage of the cyclonic torpedoes. Perhaps he simply wished to ensure the total destruction of all the Doom-Eater vessel’s inhabitants. Regardless, without shielding, without weaponry that could target the Blood Raven fleet or shoot down the torpedoes, the Doom-Eater found itself cracked apart. Fire engulfed its innards, setting off hundreds of smaller explosions as stockpiled ork explosives and entire lakes of fuel were ignited as well. For a brief moment a blinding light was born in the dark places between stars, before that light too faded.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===============================================<br/>​</div>In time, the full scope of things would be revealed, as they always would. When the Imperial Navy arrived, utilizing deciphered information taken from the Doom-Eater’s raiding fleet – finally caught and destroyed in its entirety by the brave men and women of the Imperial Navy in the Agrax system – they were surprised to find the Blood Ravens fleet corralling its remains. The Mechanicus detachment sent by Zerann, joined together in cooperative effort thanks to the diplomatic works of Admiral Graves, was mortified by the sheer size of the greenskin construct. Many had worried over the sheer distance from the light of the Astronomicon, but the navigators had been sure that they could still yet see the light of Terra emanating from beyond its normal borders. Weaker, to be sure, a film over a photograph, perhaps, but more than strong enough for their purposes. Augur arrays poked and scanned at the remains of the ships which had been destroyed in the fighting, carefully looking over the damage dealt to the astartes vessels as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is, oddly, a near mirror to an encounter in the past.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master Angelos,” Graves began with eyebrow raised, “This is a surprise indeed.”<br/>
<br/>
The years had changed little of the man’s frame, his dark brown skin perhaps a bit more weathered than before, but his eyes remained clear enough and his body held the various medals on his chest easily. There were even more than Gabriel remembered from the last time. The holographic image displaying him was soon enough joined by a red cowled member of the Mechanicus, their face and body so thoroughly modified as to remove any signifier of gender or age. Only their station as a magos was discernable through the markings of their station.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master Angelos,” they bowed their head slightly, “Greetings from Zerann.”<br/>
<br/>
“Greetings to you both,” Gabriel nodded to them both. “We have much to discuss about the Doom-Eater.”<br/>
<br/>
“I presume that was the name of this…vessel?” Graves posited.<br/>
<br/>
“You presume correctly.”<br/>
<br/>
By right of conquest, the wreckage was the Blood Ravens. But, as they had no use for it, the Mechanicus as more than happy to take the scrap to be reconstituted into proper Imperial goods after processing. The sheer quantity of metal was certainly useful after reforging, and while much of the internal electronics of the Doom-Eater were rendered entirely useless, raw materials would almost never be ignored considering the source. Had they been tainted by Chaos or other such powers, perhaps, but the sheer primitive nature of the greenskin ensured that at the end of the day, iron was iron. Steel was steel. Gold was gold. And by being put through the holy forges of the Omnissiah, even these base metals could be redeemed in the barrel of a lasgun or in the bullets of a stubber. Certain weapons of war, looted from the Imperium itself, would even potentially find themselves reconsecrated once more. One captain would find, in years to come, that his ship’s macro battery weaponry always did seem to be on a bit more of a hair trigger than normal.<br/>
<br/>
The battle was, for now, over. But the wars raging throughout the galaxy would continue. The Blood Ravens, for their part, returned to Subsector Aurelia, to grieve the dead and dedicate the new blood who had proven themselves time and again. Where, in turn, they would be met by the grossly opulent messenger ship of the Tarquindil Dynasty, whose inhabitant dropped their pretense of foppery the moment he was allowed onto the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i> and did not have to pretend for his hangers on any longer. The agent of the Inquisition barely spoke at all, instead providing a small piece of technology that soon flickered into life, revealing the floating holographic image of the Inquisition’s symbol along with several codes which proved the veracity of the message being delivered.<br/>
<br/>
“Blood Ravens,” the unmistakable voice of Inquisitor Lord Christina Brutus Alba Tarquindil came through with crystal clear clarity. “As per our deal, I have succeeded.”<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel’s eyes widened.<br/>
<br/>
“Governor Vandis’ trail has been found, towards Segementum Obscurus.”<br/>
<br/>
All of the Chapter’s leadership were present, save for Captain Hadrian and the Chief Apothecary, the latter rather busy with keeping the former under his ministrations. None could possibly mistake the deliberate pause in the recording’s voice.<br/>
<br/>
“However. As before, we discussed your Chapter’s contributions to the Deathwatch for matters most dire in our operations across the galaxy. I have been informed as to your communications, and your receiving of targets. The information on Vandis, then, will be freely given as soon as you succeed in destroying one.”<br/>
<br/>
There was, of course, the immediate animal impulse. Anger. Fury at being denied the path towards one who had corrupted and stolen from them before managing an escape. But it cooled just as quickly. Gabriel, for one, knew from the Inquisitor’s own lips just how dire the Deathwatch’s situation was. Others were less forgiving, though only Apollo openly showed it with a muttered curse beneath his lips. If Hadrian were here, Gabriel knew, he would be likely screaming his head off. Hannibal, contrary to expectations, merely went silent while flicking on the power field of his crozius. The Inquisitorial adept, in turn, shied away slightly.<br/>
<br/>
“Have we not,” Gabriel said softly, eyes locked onto said adept, “Paid our way in blood? It was part of our deal.”<br/>
<br/>
“If you are questioning my choice to withhold the information, consider this,” Christina continued, the recording heedless of the reactions of those around it. “I do not ask that you throw your brothers to some distant battlefield, alone, to die away from your Chapter. Succeed, and you will both have your information on Vandis, and the appreciation of the Deathwatch…and possibly others, besides. Besides, you would be serving the Emperor, would you not?”<br/>
<br/>
She was right, damn her. They did not have to like it. And, in truth, few did. But for all they knew, Vandis was already far away, while the targets given to them were distressingly closer.<br/>
<br/>
“Any of them will do. The resources freed up will be used to assist in the destruction of the other targets. Good luck, Blood Ravens. I know you will not be found wanting.”<br/>
<br/>
The adept rather quickly scurried forward to gather up the device and head back to their ship.<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel sighed as the rest of his brothers turned to look at him.<br/>
<br/>
“It seems we have no choice,” he said without a hint of exhaustion. "Let us discuss battle plans."<br/>
<br/>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">[] <b>Deathwatch Campaign Offers:</b> The Deathwatch is being entirely overwhelmed. They are desperate for a great many more soldiers than many chapters are willing to give. They are, even, willing to give out targets to whole chapters that a single or grouping of kill-teams cannot normally defeat on their own. These are no mere minor invasions, but great gulfs of foes of extreme issue. It is highly advised that the Chapter focuses their efforts on only one of these potential targets at a time, else risk being similarly overwhelmed as the Deathwatch has been. Three major issues have been forwarded by the Ordos Xenos.<br/>
-[] <b>The Saharduin Swells</b>: The aquatic worlds of the vicious Saharduin – otherwise known as a bipedal race similar to the sharks of ancient terra – have somehow managed to remove the Imperial watch fleets set to watch over them. They have rapidly begun to rebuild their numbers, bearing somewhat Imperial-equivalent tech lines. An entire sector of Segmentum Ultima is now under threat. Their worlds are exceedingly difficult to invade, largely unexplored, and filled to the brim with their monstrous kind.<br/>
-[] <b>The Odaken Herd:</b> A new race, quadrupedal, heavily furred, with fully articulated ‘hands’ on each limb. Each is the average size of an ogryn, and they bear strangely advanced terraforming tech – or at least Odakenning tech. They prefer ice worlds, subsisting on alien consumables and some form of symbiotic algae that grows upon their bodies. This means that they’ve been taking Imperial worlds and beginning to cool them beyond human habitation capabilities. They must be driven back, the worlds retaken before losing total human habitability permanently. But beyond that, their homeworlds must be found and destroyed while the Imperial Guard sees to the former.<br/>
-[] <b>Suysh Hives</b>: Reptilian creatures bearing advanced heating and microwave weaponry technology. A favored tactic is reaching close range and boiling the insides of smaller vessels, or melting soldiers in their armor. Previously just small pirate raids into the territory of the Imperium, they’ve launched a full-scale invasion from beyond the light of the Astronomicon. At the moment, they’ve entirely claimed a full quartet of superlatively lucrative mining worlds in Segmentum Ultima, and are working to claim more. A sector is under threat in terms of current fighting, and no Imperial Guard have been able to reclaim the mining worlds specifically, busied on fighting beyond them. The Suysh are using the worlds as their own new resource bases. It is not possible, currently, to find their homeworlds. For now, the worlds they’ve taken must be reclaimed first.</div>
