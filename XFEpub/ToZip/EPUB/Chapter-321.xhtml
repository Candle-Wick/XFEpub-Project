    <h2>Turn 40 Results - 2489.5 - Part 6</h2>
When work begins on prototyping new forms of tributary, Tochter immediately gravitates towards Cadaeth's design based on entreating the Dreaming Wood to anchor a tributary stone, and Zlata towards Aksel's straightforward beseeching of Halétha. This leaves only Max unpaired, which means that more or less by default he ends up drawn into working on Niedzwenka's spirit-stones. If it were anyone else you might be concerned with how they'd react to such a domineering and condescending research partner, but you've come to know what makes Max and his ego tick over the years. In matters relating to his craft or his personal life, he's as easily nettled as he is slow to forget. But you've never seen it raise so much as a peep in his professional life, no matter how tedious or inglorious a task you give him. As far as you can tell, the reason for this is simple: he doesn't really care. Oh, he has pride in doing the best job he can, and is happy to be doing work that matters with people he likes, but at the end of the day all of this is just the price he pays for the salary, contacts, and resources to pursue his own personal vision of true transmutation.

So with impressive serenity he accepts the condescension of Baba Niedzwenka, accepting the menial tasks she places upon him and taking careful notes of every step of the way as the Hag Witch begins to gather the implements and offerings that she theorizes might be used to entreat or cajole a specific spirit into cooperation. Specifically a Melusine, a type of spring Naiad usually found in Bretonnia, associated with a bevy of tales in which they either assist and hinder knights errant according to their whims. Niedzwenka posits that a tributary is just a spring in reverse and with magic instead of water, so its creation could fall within the capabilities of a spirit. You leave them to it, trusting that Max will report back anything particularly of interest or alarm, and turn your attention to the other, more natural partnerships.

Cadaeth's problem, it seems, is not in securing the partnership of the Dreaming Wood, as Laurelorn's is as thoroughly tamed as is possible to achieve. The problem is that a Dreaming Wood does not comprehend things like Aethyric conductivity or regolith saturation or cardinality. One way to solve this is for the caster to fully and completely understand what needs to be done and open their mind up to the Dreaming Wood and simply ask it to do     this; the other is to translate what needs to be done into metaphors that the Dreaming Wood can comprehend. The problem with the former is that it means that tributary creation could only be performed by someone that completely understands the task at hand and is willing and able to expose their consciousness to an ancient and alien consciousness made up of the combined lives of an entire forest, while the problem with the latter is that an entirely new set of metaphors will need to be built to fit the conceptual idiom of each new Dreaming Wood that is enlisted to create tributaries. The debate between the two temporarily reverses the splintering of the six contributors as it draws back in everyone else to input their own opinions.

Finally, Aksel's part requires him to travel back to Forest of Shadows to properly entreat Halétha in her own territory. Considering the short distance and relative safety of the journey, you're not sure if it would be proper to call it a pilgrimage, but you do so anyway as it adds some more dramatic weight to the task at hand. Zlata seems interested in traveling with him. You haven't pried into why, as whether it's because of the complicated relationship between Kislev's magic-users and the Hedgewise that border it or something just between the two of them, it's not your business either way. Or at least, it might aggravate them if you informed them that it actually is your business, and the risks of being found out while snooping are greater than the value of knowing for sure what's going on.

With all three projects in varying amounts of underway, you leave them to it while you turn your attention to your other responsibilities for a time.

Halétha, it seems, was in an obliging mood. After barely a couple of reportedly uneventful months spent in the Forest of Shadows Aksel and Zlata emerge once more with a scribed ritual to share. The exact details make you raise an eyebrow - that if the ritual is cast outside the Forest of Shadows, it requires that the caster be of the bloodline of the ancient Was Jutones, and that the ritual chants are in their ancient and largely forgotten tongue, could lead one to suspect that Aksel crafted the ritual to ensure that the Nordland Hedgewise could not be cut out of the project. But it's an entirely deniable suspicion, as it's far from the most obscure requirement you've heard of from a ritual, and the hand at work here may be that of Halétha herself. The other downsides of the ritual are the cost, as it requires and consumes a lodestone each time it is performed, and what happens if it is fumbled, as it not only riles up local spirits but also makes any spellcraft that might be employed to defend oneself from them more dangerous to perform. Considering the sorts of spirits that tend to accumulate in areas with excess magical energies that need draining away, that could get rather dangerous.

Hopefully the other two projects will find equal success.

You check in regularly with Cadaeth and Tochter's camp within the Golden Wood, but even then you find yourself having to communicate by exchanging letters as much of their efforts are located within the Dreaming Wood, which is not so conveniently accessible here as the Wishing Woods with its massive portal and obliging servitors. It seems that their efforts had seemingly responded to the dual contributors, as the ritual had morphed over weeks of iterations to require a second caster, and then after several months of unchanging effort, a breakthrough sees the ritual overhauled out of the Anoqeyån that Cadaeth preferred into the Lingua Praestantia that Tochter has been pushing for since the start. In the end the final piece of the puzzle was the inclusion of some sort of ritual drinking horn common to most of the nature deities you know of, and when the two of them finally emerge it's with a complete ritual ready for distribution. The ritual requires the presence of a Dreaming Wood, of course, but also requires that the caster has spent a significant amount of time within it recently, and if fumbled will permanently cut off the local copse from the Dreaming Wood. The responsible way to deal with this is apparently to clear-cut the lot, because the alternative is that the sort of malevolent creatures that the Dreaming Wood outright rejects can find refuge within it.

All the while you've been receiving regular reports from Max, who tells of Niedzwenka alternately cajoling and threatening a Bretonnian water-spirit into cooperation, though not as an actual contributor to the ritual, more as a sort of medium through which to operate. These reports do confirm that the ritual has grown to require a steady supply of biscuits, the acquisition of which you'd previously assumed to be the most minor form of embezzlement imaginable, and apparently hovered on the precipice of success pretty much from week one and refused to cross that final threshold for almost half a year. Eventually the formidable witch got frustrated enough with being roadblocked at the final threshold, and at being mocked for it by a surprisingly mouthy Bretonnian river ghost, that she took it as a personal affront and reworked it entirely so that it could incorporate any type of water spirit, apparently to lend her threats to replace the Melusine with more weight, as well as paring down the time it requires to cast from a full week to a mere two days. Max reports that it's hard to say whether the tension between Niedzwenka and the spirit was simply a demonstration of a heavy-handed and domineering form of spirit-wrangling, or if it was a product of a ritual that seems to enrage the spirit contributor upon failure.

The final round-up of results presents a triumph on all fronts, albeit one requiring a careful smattering of qualifying footnotes, as all three rituals are capable of creating a tributary and thereby bolstering the Waystone Network anywhere it currently stretches to. However, the plain fact of the matter is that you're unable to take this back to the Colleges and begin implementing it entirely in-house, though you're still debating whether to call this a problem or an opportunity, as by chance or, more likely, by design, all three require resources or expertise outside the domain of the Colleges.

The Haléthan ritual, dubbed 'Roots of Stone', requires a working knowledge of the near-dead language of Was Jutonian - only spoken by the Hedgewise and a handful of extremely isolated villages. A second major limitation is that to be cast outside the Forest of Shadows, it requires someone descended from the Was Jutonian: those members of the Jutones tribe that stayed true to the Goddess of the Forest of Shadows instead of leaving Her and it to attempt to conquer the lowlands of what would become Westerland, and returning with nothing to show for it but a faith in the God of the neighbouring Teutogens, Ulric. A bloodline only really found within the Hedgefolk of Nordland and Ostland, as it happens. Fair enough, considering the ritual does call upon said Goddess for her assistance, and that it can be cast within the Forest of Shadows itself without that limitation suggests that it might be an actual requirement instead of an attempt to make the ritual unusable to outsiders - it could be that for the Goddess to intervene outside of her domain requires the presence of a bloodline that has been faithful to her for millennia.

The Dreaming Wood ritual, 'Liminal Germination', is mainly limited by requiring both the presence of, and a considerable amount of time spent within, a local Dreaming Wood. You're not yet knowledgeable enough on the subject to be able to say how much of a limitation that might be, though your understanding so far suggests that the kind of places that most need magical energies drained out of them tends to have a rather unruly Dreaming Wood as a direct or indirect result. Of the three rituals, this one possesses the most Collegiate fingerprints, as it uses Lingua Praestantia and has incorporated as a requirement a sort of ritual drinking horn that would be easy to source from the Druids or the Cult of Taal. It is also, of course, of no use anywhere that does not possess a Dreaming Wood.

The Hag Witch ritual, whose Reikspiel name of 'Aethyric Impluvium' is almost certainly the work of Max, might be the crown of the three, as it takes a mere two days to perform instead of the full week the other two require, and can be performed anywhere where liquid water can be found. It does require the presence, if not strictly the cooperation, of a water-spirit, which is outside the expertise of the Colleges - perhaps the Cults of Taal and Rhya might be able to help with that, or perhaps, as a last resort, the Elementalists of Nuln - and presents a danger in that if failed, the magical effort invested in the ritual goes to empowering and enraging said spirit. Another limitation is that it requires a grasp of Scythian, the language of the ancestors of the Kurgan, Gospodar, and Ungols, which is kept alive only as the arcane language of the magical traditions of Kislev.

You don't really begrudge anyone for perhaps having influenced the trajectory of the ritual so that the Colleges could not effortlessly steal all three and cut out their creators. All three would, under a strict reading of the Accords, normally be the prey of the Witch Hunters within the borders of the Empire. And from a certain perspective, that this might force greater cooperation between Imperial authorities and the magical societies of the Hedgewise, Eonir, and Hag Witches could be a benefit, rather than a limitation, of what you've done here. All in all, you're happy to call this a victory.

Back when you were designing Rite of Way, you interviewed a number of logistical experts in the potential terrain-induced difficulties that one might encounter when trying to move at speed, and took rather extensive notes while doing so. You have to stretch to imagine who it might be immediately of note for - road architects? Artillery logisticians? - but if it was useful to you, it might one day be useful to someone else, and not every paper you put your name to needs to shatter the status quo and carve your name among the stars. So you spend the time to get your notes in order and get to work on converting it to something more accessible to someone that isn't you.

[Writing: Learning, 76+29-10(Faded)+5(Library: Geography)+1(Library: Logistics)=101.]

It was never going to be a page-turner, but you can take pride in making it at least easy to get at. You took out your long-standing dislike of vague tables of contents and absent indexes to ensure that if information within these pages was of use to someone, they'd be able to find the part that's relevant to them. Not the greatest contribution to your legacy, perhaps, but if nothing else, it will get your name onto the bookshelves of people who otherwise would have no reason to read your works.
