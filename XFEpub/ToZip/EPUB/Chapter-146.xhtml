    <h2>Waaagh Birdmuncha, Part 5</h2>
When it comes to re-grounding yourself, a gyrocopter jaunt is probably not the best way to go about it, and as you enter the Citadel once more you do your best to mask your mental fatigue and the odd sense of claustrophobia from being reduced to a single point of reference and a mere eight senses. Most of the leadership of the Expedition is elsewhere, but King Belegar, Princess Edda, Kragg and Thorek are waiting for you on a balcony overlooking the Caldera.

"Fine work," Kragg says, leaning against the parapet and gazing out at a sea of ash in satisfaction.

You consider and reject a number of different responses before settling on "thank you".

"Bit exotic for my tastes, but I can't argue with the results," Thorek half-grumbles.

"Day's not done yet," King Belegar says. "There'll be accolades aplenty once all is said and done, but right now, we can't leave them to their own devices under there. If they find a crevasse through the bedrock, the Under-Caldera can take them anywhere. If they get into the Trench or Zilfin Dum or the Great Mines, it'll be years of fighting and decades of work to get them out again."

"The greenskin ecosystem takes a lot of work to properly eradicate," Princess Edda says, and matching grimaces appear on her and your faces as you recall the troubles in Karag Lhune. "The Skaven had the numbers and the appetites to eradicate it below, but if it has a chance to re-establish itself..."

"I've signalled for Karagril and Karag Mhonar to be unsealed, I want as many hands applied to this as possible," says King Belegar.

"Tunnel fighting," you note.

"In tunnels dug by Snotlings," Princess Edda adds.

"In soil," Kragg finishes, but his tone is more thoughtful than disgusted.

"Tremors?" Thorek says, equally thoughtfully.

Kragg shakes his head. "Can't confirm the kill from just burying them. Lava."

"Could weaken the bedrock."

Kragg opens his mouth to object, then frowns. "Four thousand years of no proper maintenance, could do. We need an upheaval of some sort."

"Rapid condensation boil... no, would lose too much energy getting it through the soil."

"Soil vaporization, transmitted through the bedrock?"

Thorek shakes his head. "Tested it. Bedrock under the Caldera is completely separated from that of the Eastern Valley. We'd need to shift the Anvils into the Under-Caldera." King Belegar and Princess Edda have largely tuned out at this point, but you're making mental notes as best you can.

"Go from above, then. Liquefaction."

"Might be enough water in the soil if we concentrate it, but it would just bury the tunnels, same problem as the tremors."

"Boil that," you say. Both Runelords turn to you.

"It's likely there's barely enough water as it is, boiling it out of the soil would re-solidify it," Thorek says.

"Not the water, the liquefied soil," you say.

"It's not actually a liquid-" Thorek begins.

"Hear her out," Kragg says.

"Reality's still twanging from the Eye, and the greenskins are still maintaining a Waaagh field, I can taste it from here. Between them, what something literally is doesn't matter so much, not right now. If it looks like a liquid and acts like a liquid, it can be boiled like a liquid."

"Zhuf logic," Thorek says doubtfully.

"Zhuf logic just killed half a Waaagh," King Belegar interjects. "Will it work?"

"The Runes won't actually be touching what's going on in there," Kragg says thoughtfully. "They'll simply be shifting things about - moisture, movement, heat. So they won't necessarily reinforce proper physics."

"It might work," Thorek admits, "but there's never certainty with Zhuf logic, that's what makes it Zhuf logic."

"Do we have something better than 'might'?"

Thorek and Kragg exchange looks. "Not without preparation," Thorek finally concedes.

"Then do it. Princess Edda, your Throng is in the Caldera to react to greenskins boiled out of their tunnels. Take the Besiegers, use crossbow volleys, don't take chances. There'll be glory enough to go around when this is done. I'll put King Kazador on the West Gate to keep out the stragglers while Prince Gotri keeps bombing them, and Huzkul and Angrund can patrol the Under-Caldera and hopefully catch any greenskins that manage to find a way through the bedrock. Move quickly, there's only so much daylight left." The three of them step to it, and moments later you're left with King Belegar. "You alright?" he asks.

"The Eye took a bit out of me," you admit. "But I've still got some left."

"Glad to hear it." He turns and stares over the Caldera, and the still forest of blackened bodies and the hints of the tunnels underneath. "You're welcome to join me in the unenviable task of watching instead of doing, but now more than ever I've faith that you know how best you can contribute."

---


Where should Mathilde be for this final stage of a very long couple of days?

[ ] In the Caldera with Princess Edda.
Fighting the greenskins unearthed by the Runelords, one group at a time.

[ ] Holding the Western Gate with King Kazador and Prince Kazrik.
Holding off any latecomers that still want to join the Waaagh.

[ ] Harassing the stragglers in the Western Approach and the Badlands with Prince Gotri.
-[ ] on your Steed of Shadows.
-[ ] from a gyrocopter.
Making sure the stragglers remain easy pickings for Da Howlaz instead of pressuring the Western Gate or returning to Karak Drazh.

[ ] Patrolling the Under-Caldera with Dreng and Gunnars.
If any greenskins do get through the bedrock, prevent them from slipping through into the rest of the tunnels and re-establishing the greenskin ecosystem there.

[ ] In the Citadel with King Belegar.
Supervising, managing, being on hand to respond to anything unexpected, and taking some time to recharge. The Undumgi and the Fieldwardens will be holding the Citadel in case the greenskins decide to continue with their original plan.


- There will be a two hour moratorium.
