    <h2>Anniversary Boon Vote [VOTE NOW CLOSED]</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper">Wow. Seven years, huh? Wild. I did something like this for DoDA, and don't mind doing it here. Thanks to those of you who have stuck through, or at least stuck around with a cursory interest in the stuff I write, all this time. And to those who have come in the meantime, I welcome and thank you as well! As thanks, reward, and celebration in this time of American holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, even my birthday coming up, I have something. Well. Several somethings.<br/>
<br/>
But you only get one, yeah?<br/>
