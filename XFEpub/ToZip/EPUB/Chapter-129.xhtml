    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 1 (11am)</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[X] Plan: Lupercal's Besiegers Attacking
-[*] Secure the Underway between Karag Lhune and Karagril. (Clan Huzkul)
-[*] Reinforce Karagril's defences via the Underway. (Throng of Karak Azul, Border Prince mercenaries, Thorek Ironbrow)
-[*] Reinforce the Citadel's defences. (The Undumgi)
-[*] Gather in the Citadel. (Clan Angrund, Karak Izor immigrants, Braganza's Besiegers)
-[*] Shift the Karag Lhune underway siege weapons to Karagril (15 Grapecannon, 10 Scorpio Bolt Throwers)
-[*] Shift the Eastern Gate siege weapons to the Citadel (10 Grudge Throwers, 10 Dwarf Cannon, 10 Ballista Bolt Throwers)
-[*] Have Kragg's Anvil of Doom positioned on the un-leased Citadel tower. (Kragg the Grim)
-[*] Keep them in reserve.
-[*] Oversee the battle from the Citadel.



A flurry of orders goes out from the Citadel and throughout the eastern half of the Karak, tens of thousands begin to move with purpose. Clan Huzkul to secure the underground passage to Karagril, and the forces of Karak Azul to reinforce the Karagril miners. Karag Lhune and Nar both disgorge small armies as the Undumgi and the remaining local Dwarves march to the Citadel. Engineers move with purpose to unbolt siege weapons and bring them to the battle. And though most of the gyrocopters are to remain in reserve for now, a single one flies out and once more lifts Kragg's Anvil atop a tower of the Citadel.

Having given the orders, there's nothing else to do but wait for them to play out, as you stare out an arrow slit down at the caldera, and at the thousands of Orcs and Goblins charging in every direction in a disorganized attempt to find a new home for themselves. To the North, a steady but muffled beat of gunpowder discharges are all the evidence you can see of the defence of Karagril, but the defence of the Citadel is entirely visible to you. And despite the rain of assorted missiles from siege weapons and Halflings, they charge enthusiastically onward, and a clanging of metal is added to the din as they do their best to make their way through the reinforced gates.

[Citadel vs Orcs: 41+15+20(firing position)+10(siege weapons)=86 vs 90+10+20(WAAAGH)=120.]
[How equipped are they to get through?: 23.]
[Karagril defence: rolling...]

There's no denying their enthusiasm, but Dwarven fortifications takes more than Orcish muscle and crude iron to batter it down, and every second they remain at the base of the Citadel is another volley scything through them and another step closer the Undumgi reinforcements come. You scowl down at the greenskins, wishing there was more for you to do than wait for your orders to play out, but such is the curse of command.

[Citadel vs Orcs: 93+15+20(firing position)+10(siege weapons)=138 vs 7+10+20(WAAAGH)=37.]
[Greenskin morale check: 4.]
[Karagril defence: rolling...]
[Karag Yar defence: rolling...]
[Karag Zilfin defence: rolling...]

By the time the Undumgi arrive, the greenskins have realized their strategic blunder and retreated from the gates they had no way to get through, and news reaches you of Karagril via the agonizingly slow and imprecise flag signals. They say there were initial setbacks, but then the enemy were defeated and ran. Judging by the flow of greenskins out of Karags Yar and Zilfin, they did no better there than they did against Karagril or the Citadel, and now the Broken Toof are milling about the far end of the caldera, and already several brawls had broken out over who should be blamed and who should take charge. Eventually some sort of a decision is made...

[Rolling...]

...and the badly-mauled greenskins turn right back around and charge into Karag Rhyn, where they had initially poured from. You shake your head in exasperation at the sheer pointlessness of their actions.

With that initial problem solved, the Caldera once more clear, and all your forces moved to the front lines, you now have to consider what exactly to do with them. Your main priority is ensuring that Clan Mors does not emerge from this fight as a resurgent power, which they very well could if they're able to defeat Clan Eshin and once more replenish their supply of slaves, food, and resources - especially with Clan Skryre's current misfortune. You're also aware that there's likely to be all sorts of possibilities to not only prevent disaster, but also expand the held parts of Eight Peaks as opportunities present themselves. But it's also vital to be able to defend what you take, and to remember that tomorrow will bring the enormous Red Fang Waaagh to the Western Gates.

Another possibility occurs to you: you've travelled from Karak Eight Peaks to Karaz-a-Karak before via gyrocopter, and if you send word to them, the Karaz-a-Karak Aircorps would be able to reach you before the Red Fang Waaagh does. But though you have the power to do so on behalf of the Karak, given the tensions between Karak Eight Peaks and Karaz-a-Karak, you're not entirely sure how good an idea it might be.


Current Priority: Weaken Clan Mors
Secondary Priority: Prepare for Red Fang arrival
Possible Target of Opportunity: Karag Rhyn - Broken Toof

Karak Izor immigrants: 10,000. Well armed and experienced. Mix of ranged and melee.

Spoiler: Map of Karak Eight Peaks











- There will be a four hour moratorium. Voting will be in plan format. The vote for whether to request aid from Karaz-a-Karak will be separate. Remember to keep all your voting in one post.
- Any forces left where they are will defend that location.
- Though there's no specific option for it, you can also move forces between already-held locations. Something like '[ ] Move unit X to place Y' will do fine.
- Each 'turn' of this battle will be an hour long. It is currently 11am. Red Fang will arrive in somewhere between 20 to 28 hours at their current pace.
- Clan Huzkul can advance from their current position as if they were at Karagril.
- Force estimates: of about 20,000 Broken Toof greenskins that emerged from Karag Rhyn, about 4,000 returned.
