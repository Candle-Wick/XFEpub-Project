<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Dis ain’t roight,”</b></span> Da Great Prophet grumbled, rubbing at his metal skull plates with an astonishingly delicate movement of his massive power klaw.<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"> <b>“Ol’ One Eye was supposed ta come out by now so ‘e could see me burning Gork’s face into Armageddon.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
And Mork’s face too, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
“Uh, boss,” one of the smaller Warlords spoke up, “I dunno if ‘ees comin’. Ya thumped dat ship of deres right propa.”<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Shaddup Blacktoof!”</b></span> Da Prophet smacked the Overfiend of Octarius hard enough to send him flying with a simple backhand.<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"> <b>“Dat’s not the point! I had da ‘ol ambush set up and everythin’.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
What could possibly have saved the One Eye from falling right into his 'bestest' ambush yet?<br/>
<br/>
It was, to be sure, a great and consternating issue that had the Beast of Armageddon contemplating the smoke filled skies from atop the closest Mega-Gargant that he’d seen while stomping around squishing dying humies. Enough that he’d dragged together a great number of his mightiest attendant Warlords and their lesser Warbosses just to rant at them about it. Those that had questioned as to <i>why</i> a ‘con-fa-rance’ was needed just to complain about some single humie were subsequently sent tumbling off to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Ee should’a been ‘ere,”</b></span> Ghazghkull muttered, scraping Mork’s face into the hull plating of the very top of the Mega-Gargant as it continued to pour fire at the crumbling defenses of some humie ‘Hive’ or another.<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b> “Else I wudda stayed over in Octarius, smashed more buggies.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the Great Prophet was silent, letting the volume of gunfire, cannons, and screams of ‘Dakka Dakka Dakka’ fill the air at such volumes that any humans nearby still alive would most certainly have had their eardrums exploded into uselessness. With a great and horrifying crash – to those who fought for Armageddon still – another series of walls were blown down entirely instead of sustaining simple holes by a nearby charging Mega-Gargant which then found itself slowly collapsing apart from the sheer violence of its weaponry firing all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Ghazghkull contemplated the collapsing mobile temple to Gork and Mork, and then scoffed with disgust and turned away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Roight. Bugger dis. I’m leaving.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
“Wot?!”<br/>
<br/>
“But Ghazghkull, ya just got ‘ere and we’ze almost done wiff da-,” Wazdakka said before he abruptly found his lower jaw removed by single precise power klaw swipe.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the ork stood dumbly before nodding stiffly and stomping off to go find a dok who could either put it back on or replace it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“I left da first time cause it got boring, and now dat One Eye ain’t comin,”</b></span> Ghazghkull groused, <span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“For <i>wotever</i> reason. Now dere ain’t nobody here wot got me interested. So I’ze gonna go spread Da Wurd again.”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
“Where’zya gunna go, boss?” asked the newest of his followers, one who had led a WAAAAAGH!! himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Well, Urgok,”</b></span> Da Great Prophet chuckled darkly, <span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“I’ze thinkin’ dat da git over in Charadon ‘aze been to complacent, yeah? Too much sittin’ around, not enuff <i>foighten</i>. So I’m thinking,”</b></span> he slammed his power klaw against the roof of the Mega-Gargant hard enough for it to tear all the way through and smush a dozen eavesdropping grots. <span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“I’m thinkin’…dat da ‘Arch-Arsonist’ is about to get a good ol’ heaping…of DA WURD!”</b></span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><br/>
================================​</div> <br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“DA WURD, mind ya,”</b> </span>Ghazghkull spoke at an absurdly calm volume which for him was at least enough to set a few gretchin ears to bleeding.<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b> “I’ze ta foight, and foight gud!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
Snagrod, Arch-Arsonist of Charadon, groaned before struggling to his feet, the mighty xeno not even coming all the way up to chin height of the Warlord who had arrived with such impunity within the Ork Empire of Charadon and challenged him to a duel. For a foul greenskin which had lasted for over a century in his position, the impossible reversal of strength and power was near incomprehensible. But mercy was a humie concept, and one that Da Great Prophet elected to use extremely rarely if ever at all. As such, his power klaw opened wide and clamped around the Arch-Arsonist hard, cutting into and bursting the dozens of promethium tanks secreted around the fire-obsessed ork’s body.<br/>
<br/>
<b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000">“Cept, ‘eres da problem. Ya do plenty of foighting…,”</span></b> Ghazghkull then roared as fire exploded down the length of the power klaw and similarly set the Arch-Arsonist aflame. <span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“BUT YER AIN’T DOIN’ NUFFIN GOOD!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
The ruler of an entire ork empire bellowed in surprise as the flames Snagrod had so beloved spread across his body, setting the great green bulk aflame with such speed as to turn the flesh to black and superheating the metal that had been seared into the ruler’s body at the same time. Yet they were an ork nonetheless, and so screaming in more anger than pain the Arch-Arsonist rose to its feet and began to clash again and again against Ghazghkull with all the strength and brutal will that it had taken to retain control over such a tumultuous thing as an ork empire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“You ain’t krumped da Ultraboyz, ya ain’t krumped nowhere near da same buggies dat the Octarius boys did. AND YA CAN’T EVEN SMUSH BUT ONE ZOGGIN’ WORLD A BEAKIES!?”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
The wordless scream of his opponent did nothing more than make Ghazghkull roll his eyes as he contemptuously blocked the first strike and stepped out of the way of the second.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Ah c’mon Snagrod, yer embarrasin’ yerself,”</b> </span>he moaned before finally smashing the Arch-Arsonist to the ground with a literally spine-shattering thump to the back.<br/>
<br/>
“Shaddup and foight!” Snagrod snarled as he writhed back and forth to try and stab at his opponent still even as his flesh began to run like wax.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Roight, dis is stupid. I ain’t gonna waste time killin’ orks when it’s da orks dat are supposed to be doin’ da killin uv every other git!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
With that, Ghazghkull dragged Snagrod up and shoved him away into the waiting hands of an ecstatic Grotsnik.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“Fix ‘im up Dok. Now den,”</b></span> Ghazghkull turned to face the massive crowd which had turned out around him.<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b> “AS FOR DA REST OF YOU BOYZ! GET YER JAWS UP OFF DA FLOOR!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
He then lifted his power klaw high, and if some saw nightmarish green lightning pouring from his eyes and now from his klaw, then they kept quiet about it like smart gits should.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="fixed-color" style="color:#008000"><b>“I’ZE GUNNA SHOW YOU….A REAL…..WAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!!!”</b></span><br/>
<br/>
And so did the gaze of Ghazghkull fall upon the whole of the Loki Sector.</div>
