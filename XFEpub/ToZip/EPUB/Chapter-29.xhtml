<div style="text-align: center"><b>In The Name Of The Emperor<br/>
+004.M42+<br/>
+<i>Honour Your Chapter</i>+</b>​</div> <br/>
“Not only shall you not slay me here, ork,” you spit, turning and flipping your hammer into a two handed grip, “You shall kill not one more Imperial citizen, not one more battle brother!”<br/>
<br/>
From within the Thunderhawk, Apollo struggles to get upright, attempting to ignore the damage he has sustained. For his part, Warboss Sawskull only narrows his eyes, slamming his klaw against the roof of his gargant once more and in his accordance with his disgusting xeno nature has no hesitation as he roars forward. A mass of green flesh and garishly painted armor, Sawskull’s advance is faster than you would have initially suspected him capable of.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not to say that you hesitated <i>yourself</i>. Instead his sweeping claw is matched by the nigh-unbreakable head of Godsplitter, knocking back the weapon as he shoulder check the Warboss’ lower jaw to send him reeling backwards, shattered teeth scattering on the floor. The buzzsaw attached to his forehead chips the ceramite of your pauldron but does nothing more than superficial damage, while the ork manages to twist and plant his feet just as you are making ready to swing at him once more.<br/>
<br/>
Your augments wheeze and groan as you stress them, smashing your elbow down to knock away the double barreled and oversized shoota that was attached to his other arm, the barrel slamming down and still managing to fire off a punishing set of rounds that could have punched deep into your armor. Instead, it merely ends up driving deep gouges into the gargant’s own plating, an act which only serves to infuriate Sawskull even further. With a grunt you flip Godsplitter in your hand once more and slam the top of it’s head into the ork’s skull once more, this time knocking more teeth lose.<br/>
<br/>
Behind you, combat capable battle brothers have exited the thunderhawk once more, firing out into the crowds of orks milling around the gargant, doing their best to prevent any of their kin from damaging the great machine which could actually lift you away from here. None are able to spare themselves to aid you in striking down the Warboss, but despite everything you find that more than acceptable. Pride can be a dangerous thing, you know, pride had blinded you and the Blood Ravens before and it had ended with catastrophic consequences.<br/>
<br/>
You all knew, now, as a Chapter, that you were far less infallible than you could ever have hoped or wished.<br/>
<br/>
But not <i>all</i> pride is death. Not all pride is a poison. In careful amounts it can push you beyond, and perhaps in this case…you could use it. For as Sawskull’s power klaw almost manages to wrap itself around you and squeeze, you bring your arms down and force the weapon down. Instead it manages to begin cutting into your leg before you bring Godsplitter down not on Sawskull’s face a third time but instead upon the elbow of his arm bearing the damned primitive power weapon. Crimson and green lighting sparks wildly from the device with the dropping of your hammer upon it, enough to send you reeling backwards as the weapon responds almost angrily at your damage to it.<br/>
<br/>
Sawskull then rears back and before you can finish reacting, these <i>damned augments</i> not allowing you to move as fast as your flesh would have let you, backhands you in the chest with his now warped shoota’s mass. You would have been sent flying had you not planted your feet, resetting your stance almost immediately as you are sent skidding backwards without actually losing your footing.<br/>
<br/>
“I have had <i>enough</i>,” you growl to yourself, augments hissing as you step within his guard and then almost immediately dodge to the side to avoid his buzzsaw-assisted head-butt, “Of being slowed down by my own body. No more! In the name of the Emperor, I command you,” you hiss at the metal and wire and circuits within, “To <i>move!</i>”<br/>
<br/>
And you do.<br/>
<br/>
Sawskull snaps his klaw at you in a blow that could tear you apart, and you realize in that instant that he is stronger than you. He forces your own hammer strike aside, a contest of strength grinding both of your comparative weapons down until both hit the gargant’s roof once more instead of each other. Each blow is barely deflected, by both of you against the other, but as the augments steam and hiss within you, each twisting movement letting you feel the heat as they burn to keep up with your demands, you find yourself…accelerating.<br/>
<br/>
Ever. So. Slightly.<br/>
<br/>
In strength he outmatches you. In toughness, you realize as one bare instant allow you to reach for your sidearm and fire the bolt pistol directly into his armored skull and what little exposed flesh he possesses before you must return both hands to holding your hammer, you are potentially outmatched once more. His armor is not nearly as well-crafted as yours, but it is thicker, and his flesh and gristle seems uncaring of every blow you lay upon it. Again and again you dodge what would have been fatal blows, orks swarming up from inside the gargant yet ringing away from your duel in favor of charging the thunderhawk, and receive minor ones in turn.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for Sawskull.<br/>
<br/>
But then you step as fast as you desired, rather than stepping and forcing yourself to correct for the slight arresting of movement that you had grown used to your augments giving you. A side-step, a dodge, a duck, these comes to you with the speed you <i>remember</i> but have not <i>had</i> in so long. Your chest heaves with breath faster than the lungs you had been installed with had processed during your spars with Apollo, your duels with him. In this moment you felt for the first time since before your near death at the hands of Kyras as you had in the halcyon days before you knew the true rot within the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
“YOU CANNOT WITHSTAND ME, ALIEN!” you bellow, finally sliding your grip to allow a massive underhanded swing to cut upwards and slam into the bottom of Sawskull’s jaw, breaking the orkish metal affectation around it and up into the flesh and bone itself.<br/>
<br/>
Sawskull, for his part, has been bellowing his own orkish warcries throughout the fight, but in this instant he is silent, for Godsplitter has pulverized his lower jaw. Then his upper jaw. In fact, you keep your hammer progressing upwards with a strain of your arms and the might granted to you by your existence and superior physiology. It is by far one of the most satisfying kills you think you have made in quite some time indeed. Sawskull managed to score a dozen or more blows on you, tearing your armor and scarring and pitting your flesh, but all of it was minor, in the end.<br/>
<br/>
And when your thunder hammer finishes its arc, cresting into the air and fully obliterating Sawskull’s entire head, you readjust your grip with supreme speed and then bring it swinging back <i>down</i> onto the rest of his body, smashing the chest open and knocking the body far and away from you, flying back and into the crowd of orks below the gargant. You stand, then, air sucking in and blowing out of you, your lungs burning with the exertion, and you glare down at the xenos before you as they stare and for a single heartbeat process the death of their leader and his slayer in you standing before them.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Emperor blesses you, and they immediately begin to tear into one another.<br/>
<br/>
You turn, in kind, and head back to the thunderhawk, where your battle brothers acknowledge your victory with their own cries, Apollo who has gotten to his feet grinning fiercely through the blood that is currently dribbling down his chin. His own blood, thank the Emperor. There is a heady feeling percolating throughout your body, even as you realize your steps feel more sure than they have in far too long a time. The uncertainty, the vein of worry that you would forever be held back by what Kyras did to you…it has been burnt out.<br/>
<br/>
Consumed by the knowledge and truth of your victory. And in that knowledge…is power. Power of mind over body.<br/>
<br/>
As the thunderhawk takes to the skies, you lean back in the seating and close your eyes, letting the information wash over you as the gunship takes you back towards the ships in orbit. Of the Mechanicus taking full advantage of your killing Sawskull, reactivating several knights and sending them gleefully into the carnage of a WAAAGH!!! attempting to re-establish what passes for order amongst their misbegotten kind. You do not let them fight alone, either. For while you watch over Apollo in the Apothecarium, below on the planet your vehicles join in with the furious Mechanicus’s ongoing assault. Your thunderhawks reign down holy fury upon the orks, granted that rare opportunity to unleash hell with every weapon they can without fear of too much reprisal.<br/>
<br/>
There yet remains many of the orks, however. No WAAAAGH!!! is easily extinguished, to your knowledge at least. In numbers at least. While the spine of the xenos have been broken, their eagerness for fighting unto death and sheer swarming numbers cannot be ignored or denied by any measure. But there is a change to you, now. A certainty that you had thought lost. And it marks your chapter as well in turn, who strike bolder, strike true and more often, with the knowledge of your victory. Already you duel, short as it was, is being woven into the tapestries by the serfs and encoded in the annals.<br/>
<br/>
For you, it was a crucible of the mind, you suppose. And one that you emerged from scathed but unbroken.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Ravens have more than fulfilled your obligation here, though should you wish it you could easily assign a few more battle brothers to remain below to assist in the cleansing. Or perhaps you could commit all the forces you possess with you at the moment to accelerate the process. Or leave entirely, as Magos Verillian cheerfully informs you from on the ground where he stands atop a pile of corpses for wont of a better vantage point, as you have in his mind easily fulfilled your oath. In fact, with your defeating Sawskull, and the utter disarray you left the enemy in, there is no need for you to detonate the Gargant in the first place!<br/>
<br/>
Apparently he is eager to tear apart the monument to their gods and study the technology within.<br/>
<br/>
Purely to know better how to destroy orkish technology later on, he assures you.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Trontiux II is in Conclusion (Choose 1):<br/>
[] Keep some of your forces on Trontiux II to assist in cleansing, while the rest of you leave for…<br/>
- [] Write-In (Aerus, Subsector Aurelia, other??)<br/>
[] Commit the whole of the forces you have on hand to help in cleansing the rest of the orks upon Trontiux II. Including yourself and Apollo, who has been healed of his wounds for the most part.<br/>
[] Leave wholly, your oath having been declared fulfilled, and head too…<br/>
-[] Write-In (Aerus, Subsector Aurelia, other???)<br/>
<br/>
Added Victorious Reward: By a true crucible, not a test devised between you and another astartes of the Chapter but instead against a <i>true</i> foe, Angelos has pushed past his limits! The augments that he struggled with mentally and physically now seem to work in <i>tandem</i> with him, returning him to the speed and agility he once possessed before his near death by the hands of Kyras! Angelos advances to Agility 5, retains progress towards next level.</b><br/>
<br/>
GM Note: Angelos did very, very well. Good for him, I guess, though...well. Spoilers. <br/>
<br/>
P.S. GM Note: No excuses other than I was trying to finish up with school, get my degree and all that. Sorry regardless.</div>
