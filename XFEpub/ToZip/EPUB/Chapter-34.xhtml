“You shall hold me no longer!” Ansgar bellowed, and to those of the Black Templars who even now fought and died in the assault upon the camp of the ork Warlord some would swear to their dying days that the Emperor’s Champion openly radiated the holy light of the Emperor as he shattered the chains that had held him since his capture.<br/>
<br/>
“Wot you tink you got, beakie!” Morkrull bellowed, backhanding the unarmored and weaponless space marine with his power klaw, sending Ansgar crashing away into a pile of filth. “I beat ya before, I can beat ya again!”<br/>
<br/>
“Never!”<br/>
<br/>
All around, hundreds of Black Templars fought and slew the greatest greenskins of Grimskar’s WAAAAGH!!! on the long embattled soil of Armageddon itself, engaging in melee in most cases against the scrap metal axes and primitive chain weapons of the orks. Yet at the slight rise at the center of the camp where Morkrull had made his personal disgusting xenos hut, Ansgar had in fact freed himself without the aid of any of those who had spent all these years attempting to retrieve him. It was a newly promoted Black Templar who saw the battle or the most part, of the Emperor’s Champion wielding anything he could grasp at hand as a weapon against the merciless cybork who seemed all but impervious. Yet no matter the blow to Ansgar, the Emperor’s Champion refused to stay down. And indeed, the pieces of metal he found, a pipe here or a discarded choppa there, those sickly weapons struck and stabbed and carved as if made from the Forges of Mars themselves.<br/>
<br/>
“Marshal Brant, we have located Ansgar, and require your aid,” Jarold boomed from within his dreadnought, his own claws shredding the foe around him with ease even as they pathetically beat against his metal tomb.<br/>
<br/>
There was a crackle of a vox activating, and then two words.<br/>
<br/>
“Deep striking!”<br/>
<br/>
From the skies, drop pods fell like hail, shattering what little cohesiveness the orks possessed in the first place further into nothingness. Each pod practically erupted its contents outwards, dreadnoughts and more Black Templar battle brothers tearing their way into the disorganized orks. Cyborks fell, nobs fell, and grots were trampled underfoot by the furious space marines as they sought to expunge the shame and dishonor of allowing the Emperor’s Champion to be captured in the first place much less fail to retrieve him multiple times. But here, now, bottled in by the Imperial Guard of all things, the Black Templars had finally cornered the Warlord and sought to decapitate not only his WAAAAGH!!! and its contributions to the still ongoing War for Armageddon, but for the Chapter as well.<br/>
<br/>
“For too long, have you kept me contained, beast!” Ansgar bellowed, picking up a choppa built clearly for a nob and wielding it as if it were a toothpick, “Now you shall pay for all your crimes upon humanity!”<br/>
<br/>
“WAAAAAGH!!!!” came the rote response by Morkrull.<br/>
<br/>
Faith crashed against xenos fury.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===================================<br/>​</div>“Ansgar,” Jarold greeted with what could almost be the ghost of joy in his voice before the bloodied marine raised a hand to silence him, glaring down at his hated foe.<br/>
<br/>
“Morkrull Grimskar kept me chained as his own personal plaything for years, and in the end,” Ansgar spat a gob of bloody spit onto the corpse, “I still could not personally slay him.” He then turned towards the assembled ranks of the Solemnus Crusade, the whole of his body beaten and bruised yet his gaze unyielding. “Which of you slew him, then? Which amongst you was the one to fire the bolter round which removed his head?!”<br/>
<br/>
For more than five years had Ansgar been trapped and tortured by the sadistic greenskin. For that reason alone, and his own even further recent injuries, he did not recognize the type of damage that no simple bolter round could have inflicted. Yet such was his constitution that after a moment of furious indignant silence that he turned back to the corpse, and allowed himself to see past the film of red which had enveloped his eyes to see the truth.<br/>
<br/>
“No,” he shook his head slowly, “This was no blow of a space marine. This bears the mark of the… Assassinorum,” he grunted with disgust.<br/>
<br/>
And in truth, he was correct.<br/>
<br/>
For an extreme distance away, in a perch located on the very edges of some Imperial Guard camp or another, the Vindicare was even now calmly putting his weapons away and moving off to his next assignment. After five years of unsuccessfully chasing down Morkrull, those with the power to do so had decided to take their own path to removing the painful thorn in their sides – for they already had so many – as the Black Templars had failed to do so with enough speed to satisfy them. The assassin did not care about the suddenly impotent righteous fury of the Black Templars, he in fact cared for almost anything but his next orders.<br/>
<br/>
But the explosion out of the warp, high in orbit above, was enough to drag even his attention as well as all those who could turn their heads to see on the planet. Ships, so great in number as to be visible from the ground through the smog choked sky, had appeared in one great and dangerous rush out of the warp which even now seemed to almost scream as it was held open longer and longer so that more ships could bull their way through. Above the planet itself, where they even now fought, an utterly massive space hulk came roaring not just out of the warp but at ludicrous speeds down at the planet itself with a corona of green lightning and fire around it towards Hive Volcanus.<br/>
<br/>
Then, came the crackle of a vox.<br/>
<br/>
Of every vox still functioning, not just on the planet Armageddon but on every planet in the Armageddon sector.<br/>
<br/>
<b><span class="fixed-color" style="color:#385623">“I'M BAAAAAAAAAAAACK! HAHAHAHAHA!!! WAAAAAAAAGGHH!!!!!!!!!”</span></b><br/>
<br/>
The Beast of Armageddon had returned, and he brought with him the unleashed fury and unbridled strength of the entire Octarius Sector behind him.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===========================================<br/>​</div>The Octarius War was over.<br/>
<br/>
They had seen it happen.<br/>
<br/>
They had even, in their folly, participated.<br/>
<br/>
Yet for all that they had possessed in fury and power and strength and faith, it had amounted to nothing between the twinned forces of tyranid and ork crashing together around them.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>Eternal Crusader</i>, and those who still lived upon its almost mortally wounded remains, struggled to limp its way through the Warp. Every journey was a near death sentence, Gellar fields screeching and many times failing each jump with frantic repairs being performed again and again to patch them. Of the escort fleet, of its brother battle barges and strike cruisers and frigates, none had survived the onslaught of a victorious Ork Empire concentrated under one monstrous will that had fought so long and so hard against the tyranids.<br/>
<br/>
On the bridge, Sebastian Yarrick stared grimly forward as he held position in his place of extreme rare honor, while the serfs of the Black Templars shifted to and fro to try and repair the damage dealt to it. High Marshal Helbrecht, now bearing a bionic arm from their single failed attempt to claim the head of their target in the middle of a battle field between the greatest that the tyranids could spawn, stood next to him. Neither spoke. Neither had to. They had come to a singular agreement, unspoken after being forced into flight as their comrades and brothers died in unholy numbers to allow them to do so. And so they had pushed the ship, pushed it again and again, struggling to somehow keep up with the green tide which had seeped out ahead of them. The ship, damaged as it was, creaked and ached with each jump, each one taking even longer to repair the damage inflicted by daemons and other things, to repair the arcane technologies of the engines and Gellar fields again and again. The communication arrays were irreparable, and so the only way the message could be passed would be in person.<br/>
<br/>
They had to warn them.<br/>
<br/>
They had to warn everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The Octarius War was over.<br/>
<br/>
They had to warn them…<br/>
<br/>
They had to!<br/>
<br/>
“Initiating jump,” a serf cried out.<br/>
<br/>
Once more, the <i>Eternal Crusader</i> slipped into the warp.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, on the cusp of entering the Armageddon Sector, it did not leave it.</div>
