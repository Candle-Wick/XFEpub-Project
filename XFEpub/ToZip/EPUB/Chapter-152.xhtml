    <h2>A Meeting in Middenheim 2</h2>
"Welcome to my home away from home, Grey One," she says, running her eyes over your robes. "Thank you for heeding my invitation."

"You have the curiosity of a lot of people," you say. "I'm hoping you can sate at least some of it."

She gives a musical little laugh. "I've no doubt. It must be disquieting when the board you've been playing on starts introducing pieces of its own. Very well, in gratitude to you, what would you like to know?"

Now there's a big question. "For a start, I'd like to know more about the Eonir converting to Ulric."

"Well, not exclusively, of course," she says, smiling. "We understand most humans pick one God to venerate above all others, which isn't the way for most of our kind - and by 'our kind' I mean the Eonir, I can't speak for our scattered cousins. But we are willing, indeed happy, to pay reverence to Ulric as the God of Winter and Wolves, and some amongst us are positively intrigued by a God of War that isn't the Bloody-Handed God."

You frown. "One more to the list, then?"

"I can see why you'd mistrust that, but we act with sincerity, in this as in all things." She turns her head to watch a butterfly flap past. "You may already know that a Sacred Flame that only burns the unworthy is significant to us. The accounts of your Magnus standing in it unharmed have stood up to a great deal of scrutiny on our part. And our Priests are also interested in the Frozen Throne of Ulric, as some descriptions of it are similar to the Diamond Throne. Perhaps Ulric is a guise, or a child, of Asuryan. Needless to say, if this is the case, Ulric is indeed deserving of reverence." She hums, and tilts her head. "Or, alternately, Ulric could be a guise of Addaioth, or one of the Ellinilli we did not know still lives. If so, that He teaches His followers to withstand the torments of Ellinill speaks of His worthiness. Our Ulthuani cousins have reached an accord with Mathlann, after all.

"Or," she says, kicking her feet idly, "He is the God of the Empire in a way more literal than most realize, in that He is the God of this part of the world, perhaps kin to the Widow of Kislev. If so, we would seek accord and harmony with our host as a matter of course. Our Priests are still learning all that the Cult of Ulric are willing to teach us, and debating the matter amongst themselves."

You're still frowning. "So you're willing to worship Ulric, without yet knowing why you're worshipping Ulric?"

She shrugs and smiles. "He has power, He is here, and He is not actively malevolent. That is enough for a foundation. We have plenty of time to get to know each other."

You can't tell if that's wisdom, whimsy, or bullshit. "Very well," you say. "The business with Nordland?"

"Ah, Nordland," she says with a sigh. "We'd not have been open to new friends and found our new God if they had stuck to their accord, so perhaps in a roundabout way we should thank them. With humans encroaching along the Salz and the Demst, our Laurelorn was getting uncomfortably crowded, and the Beastmen smelled opportunity. We couldn't encircle the Warherd without endangering too many of our people, so we had to settle for evicting them into what you call the Schadensumpf - which is quite a suitable name for it, by the way - when that lovely Boris, who was on his way home with his army after stamping out a warherd near Bokel, swept in from the south and between our two forces we quite thoroughly fertilized the marsh. Things developed from there."

"And now you're enforcing your claims."

"Naturally," she says with a shrug. "If it was just us, Nordland could ignore the treaty and try to turn it into a matter of humans against Elves. But Middenland being involved means that if they do try to escalate it, your Emperor will pay close attention, and very quickly find that your law is on our side."

Not a thought for the peasants caught in the middle, both those that got disappeared by the Eonir and those that would have perished under Middenland blades to seal the alliance if the Winter Wolves hadn't spirited them away to the other end of the continent. You wonder if this is characteristic of her kind, or if it's just her. "Very well," you say. "Why did you want to meet me?"

She looks around conspiratorially, which is absolutely an affectation since this is a pocket dimension filled entirely by her soul, and leans in. "Waystones," she says hushedly.

You frown. "What about them?"

"Eight Peaks reconnected, and we thought, okay, that's good for the Dwarves, but Dwarves being Dwarves, no real relevance to us. But then Boris passes on the transcript of the lecture on greenskin magic, which some of our mages found intriguing because, of course, we're not capable of lowering ourselves enough to understand their magics. So we had a look into you, and when we realized that someone with an affinity for understanding magics is in Eight Peaks and working with the Dwarves, we had to speak with you. We've got our own piece of the network just as the Dwarves do, and if we could bring a few more Waystones online, it could do a lot of good for us - and our friends and allies. So we want to open a relationship with your King Belegar, in the hopes of beginning joint research into the Waystone Network."

For the second time today, you put into practice your ability to smile and nod while being full of confused screaming on the inside.
