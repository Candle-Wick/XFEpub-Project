<div style="text-align: center"><b>In The Name Of The Emperor<br/>
+004.M42+<br/>
+<i>Honour Your Chapter</i>+</b><br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">You are ready. Your leadership is ready. The Blood Ravens have skulked in the shadow of Aurelia's worlds for too long without ranging out and striking against the foes of the Imperium. <i>You</i> have remained away for too long. To think of the purge of the chapter as good and honorable battle is a fool's rendition of the past. That your near inability to capture Kaptin Bluddflag was a wonderful experience for your brothers to go through that would in the end strengthen them and improve their accomplishments in the future. You are not chapter who is based on Calderis, or even Meridian. In truth, as it has always been, you are a fleet-based chapter and all that entails. To remain ensconced within the Subsector has been an everpresent burn at the back of your mind for some time now.<br/>
<br/>
No longer.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot forge neophytes and scout marines into full battle brothers without going out and seeking a crucible to test them in. You cannot prove your purity to the Imperium without destroying its enemies and showing yourselves as such. What worth would it be to remain motionless and rebuild your numbers if what Blood Ravens emerge are sickly and weak? You cannot have that. You <i>will not have that</i>. That is a true kernel of knowledge that you need not guard. In fact, you would spread it to every corner of the chapter and beyond. The Blood Ravens are true servents of the Imperium and they will <i>not</i> stand by while it is in danger. The touch of Chaos would have dragged the whole of you into damnation.<br/>
<br/>
Kyras's endless manuevering around the Black Legion, pushing and pulling the Blood Ravens whenever battle against them was required, takes on an entirely different light, when considering all the facts. He treated you like proxies in the games that all those cursed creatures that once were true space marines partake in.<br/>
<br/>
Disgusting. But you have no time for it now.<br/>
<br/>
Now you go to face one of the greatest and eldest enemies of not just the Imperium, not just of humanity, but the very concept of order itself.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Orks</i>.<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: center">=================================<br/>
<br/>
[Training With Apollo – Agility From 4 to 5: 202+93(Turn 4 Retroactive)+74=369/500]<br/>
[Chapter Training – Toughness: 226+69+Tarkus(25)=320/600]<br/>
[Junius Negotiations: 30/100]<br/>
[Warp Travel – 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company: 1d10 = 6. No Disasters]<br/>
[Warp Travel – 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company: 1d10 = 4. Turbulent Travel]​</div> <br/>
There is an almost feverish pace to the training that the chapter involves itself in as you make way towards Trontiux II. Though the Blood Ravens have had little contact with any Knightly House in the Imperium your agreement with the Mechanicus is bringing you forth to the aid of not only one Knightly House but an entire world of them. Even as you and Apollo exchange blows and spar endlessly, the ships fly forth through the void and then finally the warp itself. Even as that cursed realm wraps itself around the vessels of the chapter you remain focused on the battles raging within the ships.<br/>
<br/>
Though the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company remains at a fraction of their total possible number, there is one important thing to remember.<br/>
<br/>
Whole worlds have been won or lost by a single squad of space marines.<br/>
<br/>
Entire WAAAGH!s have been broken before by a single successful assassination.<br/>
<br/>
The 3<span style="vertical-align:super">rd​</span> Company itself on Tartarus needed no other aid save from what guardsmen were there.<br/>
<br/>
Better and worse have been done with single companies across the entire Imperium.<br/>
<br/>
How can you do anything less than find total victory?<br/>
<br/>
By the time that Martellus has finished buffing out the dents left in your largely metal hide by Apollo and the ships are nearing their destination you are within the massive Librarium of the <i>Litany of Fury.</i> It pains you somewhat to gaze around at the voluminous amounts of knowledge stored here that goes so rarely frequented now. The ranks of the librarians, for your chapter at least, were always quite high in number. Despite what Isador may have ever thought, you do not begrudge the psyker for their nature. For the sake of the Emperor the entire chapter’s doctrines in battle and function were <i>based</i> around such things and you saw little fault in that.<br/>
<br/>
“Brother Maphar,” you nod towards the recently re-armed librarian.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master, Captain,” he nods in return towards you and towards Cyrus. “I have prepared everything for you.”<br/>
<br/>
It in not in the nature of the Blood Ravens to rush headlong into conflict. The Aurelian Crusades were not prepared for, no augurs made, no tarots consulted. That Aramus managed success besides all of that was actually more suspicious than it would have been had he failed…but there is no time to muse on him. But no, when you are <i>planning</i> for a campaign all knowledge that is possible to collect is used. Plans are made first, you are no mindless wolves thrown into the fray on simple brute bloodlust. While yes, occasionally there are gaps in the knowledge of the librarium – Tartarus, again, a dark but poignant example – there are just as many if not more times when that is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
In this turn, the meticulous Mechanicus provides.<br/>
<br/>
Trontiux II was an old world already when the settlers appeared on it so long ago. Signs and archaeology digs reveal signs of some long exterminated xenos race once having claimed ownership of the planet before the near arcane technologies of the knights were put forth into battle. The Mechanicus was fascinated in what was practically archaeotech in the early days of the Great Crusade but through agreements with the knights did not swoop in and claim everything there for study. Nevertheless, the Knights agreed to give the Mechanicus more than a little authority on the world in exchange for the ‘gift’ of having Techpriests regularly arrive and perform maintenance upon the great machines.<br/>
<br/>
Rare, for worlds so far out on the Eastern Fringe, and so a valuable exchange indeed. Even if the proud nobles of the world did not truly care for having any of their leadership suborned to ‘strangers from the stars’.<br/>
<br/>
Such is the case here.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Knight Houses are ‘sure’ that victory is certain against the orks assailing them, they made the supposedly polite request for the Mechanicus to send aid at some point in order to ensure that their machines are in top shape after said presumed victory. The cult of the Omnissiah…disagreed on the prospect of waiting and arriving only to find holy technologies destroyed or even worse desecrated by greenskin hands. So in turn were the Blood Ravens approached for this. A web of connections and favors stretching forth.<br/>
<br/>
Personally? You do not care for it. Politics and such things as that are more the games of Kyras and his thankfully slain ilk. Why can you not simply arrive and slay the xenos? Go forth and serve the Imperium by exterminating its enemies? Why, because someone might grow offended. Someone might feel put out that space marines arrived and did a job that <i>they</i> – whoever ‘they’ might be in that case – would certainly have done at some point. Or so they might say. And if you are feeling particularly frustrated about politics it might or might not have to do with the fact that your application for Junius has been denied.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Again</i>.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the clerks had the kindness of letting you know by astropathic message that some quiet lobbying by the Guard in Subsector Krasus are considering recruiting from Junius themselves. Surely, it seems, if the space marines are interested in the stock of a world then might not those soldiers better serve in the guard? Bah, as if Junius is just another Catachan waiting to be discovered. You can say with surety that this sort of behavior would not be possible if the Blood Ravens were as...as they were before the purge. Before perhaps even the battles of Kronus and Kaurava where the chapter slaughtered hundred and thousands of guardsmen. Before blood and politics and faith turned black between you and these Imperial factions.<br/>
<br/>
Hmph. Campaigns such as that were set forth by Kyras, even then.<br/>
<br/>
…you can perhaps see why Apollo tastes naught but ash when recounting past glories.<br/>
<br/>
Trontiux II itself is split between five Knightly Houses, each possessing a small number of the one-manned machines. In total, thirty Knights walk the world, and even now battle the orks who have swarmed the place. In accordance with protocal, Brother Maphar has made his augurs to seek out the origin of theses beasts and their suddenly increased ferociousness and has found a site that he believes to be just that. Upon the single grand continent of the world, deep within one of its many mountain ranges, is a series of massive craters brought about by none other than a Rok shower. It is from each of these massive hollowed out asteroids which have practically collapsed an entire length of the Per’sha Mountain Range that the orks have come.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that there were not orks there <i>already</i> it is just that these were largely feral compared to the now gun wielding and wagon driving ones that now stomp about.<br/>
<br/>
By the reports of the Knight World, the scans of the advanced ships of the Mechanicus that have come alongside you, and Maphar’s own peerings into the Immaterium, the situation is thus:<br/>

				Trontiux II Briefing said:
			
		</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent">
			The single and unnamed continent of Trontiux II is drowning beneath a tide of orks that have risen up in WAAAGH! A high number of feral orks were always present but are now being forcible ‘uplifted’ by the orks who have arrived from the southern tip of the continent upon a mountain range uninhabited by humans in any larger numbers [Designation: Per’sha Mountain Range]. Spread out in a vague crescent atop mountains on the northern side of the continent are the Knight Houses who have built their keeps upon the peaks. [Designations: House Legrin (A), House Aerian (B), House Xerult (C), House Baroon (D), House Myrlen (E)] Orks are filing out of the forests and plains to assault all five positions with various amounts of strength and technology while a very heavy contingent remains with the roks far to the south of the continent presumably to either make the roks lift off again, dismantle them for parts, or anything else that might come to an orkish mind.<br/>
<br/>
Position A – Heavy assault by ork forces, largely feral with a small amount of vehicles in support and few amounts of bolter weaponry or similar. Position held by all 3 Knights of House Legrin. Base of attackers suspected to be deep within forests a distance away from the valley where refugees have fled to.<br/>
<br/>
Position B – Heavy assault by ork forces, high amount of more advanced ork weaponry. Looted tanks have appeared of the Leman Russ variety. Heavy amounts of artillery fire is being directed at House Aerian’s fortress, whose defenses have for the mean time remained viable against. Enemy base for this attacking group is openly upon the plains in a massive ork structure nearly approaching the look of a Gargant that continually pours out orkish troops and vehicles presumably by teleporter. Five knights are in defense, the whole of House Aerian’s available compliment.<br/>
<br/>
Position C – Under heavy assault by orks who are middling in number but are statistically larger than many of their fellows. Looted tanks, obviously former Imperial Artillery, and ork psykers are openly present in the attack. House Xerult’s four Knights have been reduced to two by the appearance of the dreaded orkish living weapon known as a Squiggoth and several Killa Kans. The base for this attacking force is also openly upon the plains in a similar structure as is near Position B.<br/>
<br/>
Position D – Under heavy assault by massive amounts of troops. Low amounts of armored support of any kind but sheer numbers are beginning to overwhelm the fortress and those it protects. All three Knights of House Baroon are in play. No known base, though it is suspected that they are arriving either from the forests to the south and east or from the tunnels of the mountains themselves which have been heavily mined in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Position E – House Myrlen is half destroyed, fighting is already occurring within the keep itself and the surrounding areas. Of the five Knights of the House’s compliment, all five are still fighting, but the overall position of the House is entirely untenable without support. There is no known information for the base here, and given the state of the fight it is entirely likely that all of those occupying said base uprooted for the ‘final fight’.<br/>
<br/>
Position F – Far to the south, the greater origin point of the orkish WAAGH! which has arrived on the world. Fifteen massive Roks, hollowed out asteroids and now bases for the orkish invasion. Super massive amounts of greenskins are present here, as are several Meks, ork psykers, and machinery. Little intelligence otherwise save for orbital scans showing a heavy amount of movement north towards the Knight Houses.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanicus Forces Commited: 1 Explorator Fleet, Several Skitarii Legions, Myrmidion Divisions<br/>
- Mechanicus Initial Planning: Land troops at all Knightly House Positions, reinforce defenses, Hold Position.<br/>
Guard Forces Committed: 85th Vendoland <br/>
- Awaiting Orders From Blood Ravens<br/>
<br/>
Recorded orkish war cries indicated presence of one 'Warboss Sawskull' somewhere on the planet.

As Maphar busies himself with rolling up scrolls, returning dataslates to their holders, and so on and so forth, you turn your considering eye upon the map which has been splayed out before you. If the Librarium had a greater compliment, then perhaps they could make the augurs of the past, involving psyker-based precision plan making. For now, you have but Maphar and one Codicier available for this. They could put their talents towards one of these objectives to learn more, but that would be all. Alas.<br/>
