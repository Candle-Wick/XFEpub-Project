    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 8</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] YAR: Make no move until you've scouted the Karag Yar battle.
-[*] Personally.
[*] RHYN: Assault the Trolls now.
[*] ZILFIN: Assault the mountain to slay any surviving Skaven.



Even though most of the work was done by others, no sense leaving the jobs half-done; you point the Besiegers and Princess Edda's Throng towards Karag Rhyn, reasoning that assuring there's enough crossbows per Troll is more a matter of logistics than leadership, and let King Kazador and his forces repeat their previous sweep of Karagril in Karag Zilfin. You also make sure to let him know that his forces should stay well below the snowline; the dragon might end up hostile to the Karak, but no sense in provoking it and making its hostility certain. Clan Angrund sets to work refortifying the Cavern of Stars in case Clan Mors returns while the Border Prince mercenaries take a break, and you have both meals and siege weapons brought over from the Citadel to help both in their tasks. With all that set in motion, you once more set off to see for yourself what's going on in Karag Yar.

[Infiltration: Intrigue, 72+22=94 vs ???.]

A handful of hours ago, you witnessed the midgame of a clash of titans as two powers clashed with all the might and cunning they could bring to bear. This is quite clearly the endgame, and all that remains is savagery. Corpses litter every room you pass and a disturbing amount have been fed upon as the Black Hunger levels its demands upon the survivors. It wouldn't be right to call this a battle; the few remaining pieces circle each other warily, desperately trying to conserve what strength remains while seeking an opening to whittle down their equally brutalized opponent. Or at least, that was what was happening before the dragon interrupted matters in the same way that an unexpected mortar barrage interrupts a nice game of chess. Now there are three factions in this mountain-sized game of cat and mice, and the cat is a lion and the mice won't stop trying to stab each other.

With the sole exception of Qrech, it has been an astoundingly bad day to be a Skaven in Karak Eight Peaks.

It's difficult to label either side a winner under the circumstances, but Clan Eshin seems to have been on the verge of eking out an extremely costly victory before being interrupted. You estimate both remaining forces in the low thousands, but those that remain are still formidable. Circling around Warlord Sleek with extreme paranoia are a battalion of extremely muscled Albino Stormvermin, and while Clan Eshin doesn't have anything with that much sheer punch, the trio of Assassins you noticed earlier is still active and you can taste a hint of Dhar-tainted Ulgu in the air that leads you to believe the Sorcerer is still around. And with Eshin being Eshin, chances are there are other pieces remaining hidden. Though you'd much rather face them now than how things stood at dawn, both still have the potential to be monumental headaches. But with how desperate their situation is it might be possible to bargain with one or the other. Clan Eshin can no longer hope to take the Karak for themselves, and can still claim the glory for Clan Mors' destruction. And Clan Mors might see the sense in seeking greener pastures, somewhere where the Under-Empire doesn't know where to find them. You might be able to remove one of the few remaining enemy pieces from the board, especially since you'd be bargaining from a position of power. Or you could simply act, and do your best to remove one of them more directly here and now.

Or you could use this opportunity to reach out to the dragon. Anyone approaching it in its lair will be at a disadvantage from the cold and from being within its place of power, but Karag Yar could serve as neutral ground to open a dialogue with it. And it shouldn't be hard to approach it as it goes from one group of Skaven to another.

Or for a third option, you could leave them all to it and once more rummage through the upper portions of Karag Yar for anything else that may be of use or interest. From your cursory scouting, battles seem to have rampaged through the Eshin infrastructure a few times, but it's unlikely to have been actually looted yet.
