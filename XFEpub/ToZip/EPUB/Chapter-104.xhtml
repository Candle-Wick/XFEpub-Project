Speed was all. If one moved fast enough, they could bypass near any defense, surround any foe, assault any target. Battered, bloodied, but not beaten or broken, they came. Reinforced from those who returned from the eastern fringe, from those who had come from Armageddon, from all across the galaxy, they had come with victory on their lips and a hunger for more. They joined, in turn, a great and terrible fleet, which fought alongside them. An inferno of shame and rage drove them, heralded by one of the greatest spaceborne vessels in the Imperium’s arsenal, a sacred and wretched thing formed from the last remnants of a corrupted world. It was the implacable bulwark and the unstoppable sword stroke, and it stood defiant. As they all died.<br/>
<br/>
The battleship shook, screamed rather, as the daemon-infused vessel suffered yet another blow. Even as metal flesh struggled to regenerate its engines, the beast that was a ship that was a beast writhed in pain. Lamed, set about across the bow with a series of great flames, it felt its shielding pustules exploding and revealing yet more flesh to the enemy. Great wreathes of fire were set upon it, scorching away and blasting open holes for boarding torpedos and assault rams to make their way in. Damned as they were, the crew still fought back against those same boarders, only to be slaughtered before they could even truly mount any significant defense. They fought blurs, they fought the air, and they died. Doors were no barrier, nor were shields that blazed with sorcerous runes.<br/>
<br/>
In instants, the bridge was assaulted, a great sliding bulkhead shattered with incredible force.<br/>
<br/>
“BLACKHEART!”<br/>
<br/>
The Warlord of the Red Corsairs barely had time to turn and block the first strike of Jubal Khan, and even then he was steadily forced to retreat as the rest of his crew was slaughtered. No words were exchanged, no boasts, no righteous statements of intent. There was nothing to be said. One had tried to destroy a world, the other to protect it. As Jubal struck again and again with silent merciless fury, he appeared almost as a spectre of the Raven Guard than anything else, even though his blade crackled loudly with lightning against a barely raised daemonblade. The daemon within screamed in pain and rage as the Stormseers arrived upon the bridge in force, reactors on the ship elsewhere exploding as successful boarding parties completed their objectives and retreated in quick order. Other White Scars began to reach the bridge, where Huron's own personal guard of terminator-clad warriors stood to battle against them. Storm bolters barked in time with plasma blasts. Neither groups could get close to the duel of their masters to aid them, nor could they allow their opposites to do so.<br/>
<br/>
“I will not fall here, not to you, not to anyone!” Huron finally managed to snarl out, summoning blasts of warp energy into soaring flensing blades, before with a great ripple of psychic power they were snuffed out.<br/>
<br/>
“No more sorcery. No more tricks,” Jubal declared, shoulder checking his foe forward and slicing off an arm at the elbow, sending Huron flying backwards into his command throne. “No <i>fleeing</i>,” he roared, leaping forward.<br/>
<br/>
For it was the truth. The Stormseers locked themselves together, in body and in mind, and worked a ritual of their own. For as Huron’s desperation grew, he summoned forth the power to dissipate himself back into the warp, back to safety. He had fled in such a manner before, not simply in this battle or this war but before as well, when once upon a time he had thought himself the savior of an entire sector before the Imperium turned against him. A trio of Grey Knights, centered within the circle of the Stormseers of every remaining brotherhood, boomed out with their oaths and own secret knowledge, and for the first time since the war had begun Huron felt his mastery of the immaterium falter and be stoppered up like a cork to flask.<br/>
<br/>
His armor, the bound daemons within, weakened as well. Twice, did Huron attempt to maneuver around the furious Jubal, and twice was he unable to get past. He stared, impotently, as they continued their ritual. He was no daemon prince to be bound or banished, but his arms and armor were weakening all the same. Sorcerous bolts of destruction fired by his wrist-mounted storm bolter were rendered to simple hunks of metal as they emerged, while his blade chipped and screeched with each strike against Jubal’s own blade which bore new engraved hexagramic runes of the design of the Grey Knights. Throughout it all, his vast awareness was steadily darkened, his connection to his fleet weakened, reduced to hearing only the screaming blaring of the alarms and sigils fizzling out on a dozen more consoles who died without continual infusions of soul and pain by their now-dead operators. But he was Huron Blackheart, and he refused to die well. With a snarl and twist of his arm, he tore apart the bridge consoles, allowing himself to be driven back by the Khan of the White Scars. His body was cut apart, flensed, stoking his rage ever higher, before he reached the exact point he needed. While the ship itself had long been part of the warp, it still retained certain functions. <br/>
<br/>
Such as an escape hatch, one of pure technological intent, without being frozen into uselessness by the psychic might of those assembled against him. A simple trick, but one that worked. It peeled itself open to let Huron through, falling downwards through the decks of his own ship, bulkheads shifting like bulging flesh to bar the way as Jubal attempted to follow. <br/>
<br/>
"No...no!" <br/>
<br/>
The howl from the White Scars could sear the soul of those who listened. <br/>
<br/>
"After him!"<br/>
<br/>
They would not reach him. Bound by soul-deep oaths and chains of ritual long wrapped about their frames, the most elite of the Red Corsairs, those once known as the 1st Company of the Astral Claws found themselves drawn to defending their lord. To the death, as it turned out, their bodies yanked by powers beyond them in defense, used as shields of ceramite and meat to force Jubal to take that much longer to cut through. They died, their very torn and corrupted essences snuffed out wholly by the machinations of the Grey Knights. In the time it took for the terminator squad to die to a man, Huron Blackheart had escaped. The Stormseers confirmed it as he pushed past the radius of their influence, and, no doubt, retreated back and away. He would live to fight another day, to try and enact vengeance for those who had forced him to such a point.  But, despite it all, the damage had been done. Flanked from the sides and behind, surprised, their supply lines choked off, the mighty Red Corsairs found themselves surrounded. Without Huron's leadership, for the most part. An incensed and fully roused Imperial Navy, joined by almost every White Scar in the galaxy and representatives from a great many of their Successors, aligned themselves with a fleet that dwarfed both. All three, to tear apart the massive number of slaves, ships, and daemons that Huron Blackheart had brought to bear.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">============================================​</div> <br/>
While flames across Chogoris still burned, at least they were cleansing rather than corrupting.<br/>
<br/>
Jubal stared at those flames, and brooded, not even turning as he felt and heard the approach of those who had come for him. Only after another moment, and a silent eulogy to the lost later, did he turn to face the Dark Angels. They regarded him in silence as he did them, armor rent and broken, blood weeping from a dozen wounds compared to their pristine shrouds and hoods. Yet one would only need look to the steadily being repaired wounds dealt to their Rock and their fleet to see that they had fought almost as as hard as he. In turn, he felt his own shattered bones shift inside him as he walked forward, the whistle of the wind against his clotting cuts and his empty eye socket which still wept tears of blood ever so slowly. Below, and though it would take many years, the grinding wheels of Imperial bureaucracy would ensure that Chogoris would not fall to utter ruin. After all, it would simply not <i>do</i> to lose another of the 1st Founding Chapter worlds, after the absolute fiasco at Fenris. After all, with the Space Wolves refusing to heel for any but themselves, and their location completely unknown, not even the Inquisition would dare to posit that Chogoris be purged. The High Lords could not allow for the chance that another of the 1st Founding might grow as belligerent as the Sons of Russ. <br/>
<br/>
“Azrael.”<br/>
<br/>
“Jubal.”<br/>
<br/>
It was a short and simple clasp of each other’s wrists, and Jubal did not offer one to those who had accompanied the leader of the Dark Angels and more besides. The Lion Helm prevented any sight of the Dark Angel’s face, and in truth, it was unneeded. His actions had spoken more than enough. Rather than send his forces amongst the lands of Chogoris or the other worlds within the system besides, they had set themselves heavily upon the fleet of the Red Corsairs. It was truly a battle not seen since the times of the Legions, such were the two complete forces of space marines that beset each other. Yet one had also been focused upon protecting their own forces and assailing the White Scars, and so had suffered for its split attentions. Convenience, not synchronization. Personal purpose, rather than communal warfare.<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you for your aid here,” Jubal finally murmured, “Though I suspect you will not stay long.”<br/>
<br/>
“You are correct. The Imperium is in peril,” Azrael nodded slightly, “And the Dark Angels are needed across the whole of it, now.”<br/>
<br/>
It had been a heady moment, for sure, to have what felt like a Legion of old formed again. But it could not hold forever, not with the scrutiny that they faced, not when it might become clear that the whole of the Dark Angels were searching as one. The Hunt began again, and already more than seven chapters had departed back across the Imperium to do their works. To face the foes of the Imperium, to protect its worlds, and, of course, to hunt the fallen. They were yet the Unforgiven. None of this was conveyed, as it never would be, by one leader to another. A number were heading towards the 13th Black Crusade, seeking absolution for the Sin of Fenris in the fires of those battles. Others drove towards Armageddon. Still another Chapter, the Sworn Blades, burned towards Macragge where the worlds of Ultramar lay under siege. There was nothing but silence from both Jubal and Azrael, until the latter spoke once more.<br/>
<br/>
"What shall the White Scars do next?”<br/>
<br/>
Jubal considered his words carefully, and then looked down to inspect his blade. A gift, made in the style of his kin, yet made in the hands of the Grey Knights. Even now its hexagramic engravings radiated a warm and pure light. In his mind’s eye, he saw and catalogued what remained to the White Scars, recruitment and arming, and what ships they possessed. He was silent for a full thirty seconds of consideration, before finally lowering the blade and sheathing it along his side.<br/>
<br/>
“First, we shall reclaim what was taken from us and burn out the scattered remains of Huron’s forces within the surrounding five sectors.”<br/>
<br/>
The Dark Angels made the slightest of nods before turning to leave, before Azrael stopped and turned back to Jubal.<br/>
<br/>
“And then, Jubal Khan?”<br/>
<br/>
At that, Jubal bared his teeth, revealing cracked teeth and bleeding gums from where his entire skull had nearly been pulped by one final desperate assault by the last of Huron's terminator guard. <br/>
<br/>
"Now we are no longer the ones under threat. His previous Red Corsairs were gutted. Their slaves eradicated. Their ships reduced to scrap. Now, <i>Huron</i> is the prey."</div>
