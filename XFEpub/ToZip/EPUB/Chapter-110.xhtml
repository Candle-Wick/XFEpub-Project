<i>+Through The Foe's Obliteration Do We Earn Salvation+</i></b>​</div><br/>
The Inquisitorial flotilla was outnumbered by the Blood Ravens, to be sure, but that did not mean they were to be underestimated. Where once Inquisitor Mordecai Toth had traveled in secret to the world of Tartarus, there was little secrecy required now. The threat was present and acknowledged by the rest of the Subsector’s ruling individuals who had a right to know. This time, he had arrived in a retrofitted and thoroughly well-equipped Exorcist-class Grand Cruiser, the large ship itself escorted by a duo of remarkably fierce looking escort vessels. He had come just as the chapter itself was preparing to depart, the Blood Trials concluded and implantations done, their obligations to another Ordos about to pull the vast majority of the Chapter away from the area entirely.<br/>
<br/>
When the aquila lander came to a stop within the <i>Omnis</i> hanger, it was greeted by a full assembly of the Chapter’s leadership. Hannibal Palrun muttered a faint canticle from within his helm. The Chief Librarian kept his eyes narrowed on the transport, his expression otherwise impenetrable. The newly appointed Captain Sicarius hefted his powerful cannon easily, the glint of his freshly forged iron halo gleaming in the lights of the hanger. Even Captain Thule was there, awakened for this meeting and appraised of the discussion to take place. The only one not present, in fact, was Captain Cyrus, who was busying himself with ensuring that the newest recruits were ready for the war that they were to be plunged into. Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos stood in front of them all, his honored weapon – itself granted from the Inquisitor’s own hand long ago – held at rest. All around them, the serfs and servitors of the chapter scurried back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
When the doors opened, there was the faintest psychic crackle which bloomed outwards from the lander. One that, for some of the Blood Ravens, was familiar. For others, less so. The sources of that palpable power were obvious, for Inquisitor Toth descended the ramp accompanied on each side by one of the legendary Grey Knights. The secretive chapter’s existence was one of the greater secrets that the Blood Ravens had gained over their existence, but whatever familiarity and kinship that had once been between them had died in the death throes of Kyras’ ambitions. Now they stalked down the ramps as an honor guard to Toth, who paused as he scanned the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
He had changed somewhat since Gabriel had seen him last, though that was to be expected considering the length of time and the Inquisitor’s line of work. His dark skin had grown more wrinkled and scarred, pulled tight against his skull and granting him a far gaunter appearance. His power armor was adorned with a dozen more purity seals than the last time, the heavy tome at his side remarkably pristine all things considered. The plasma pistol was holstered at his side as well, though Gabriel knew from sight alone that it remained as deadly as it had been on Tartarus long ago. Though the Chapter Master did have to blink at the sight of the crackling hammer he held once more, hefted in one hand and resting against one of his pauldrons. It was, oddly enough, a strange sister to the one that the space marine now wielded.<br/>
<br/>
Toth paused, his remaining organic eye narrowing critically at the sight of his former weapon, then up to Gabriel’s own look, then down at his current one. The question was obvious. <br/>
<br/>
“I had grown used to the heft, reducing myself back to a mere blade was not something I was willing to do,” he said smoothly before advancing further to come to a halt in front of Gabriel.<br/>
<br/>
The two Grey Knights came to a halt as well, the bottom of their glaives thumping heavily against the metal grating of the floor.<br/>
<br/>
“Greetings, Inquisitor Toth,” Gabriel nodded his head gravely, “I am glad the Ordo Malleus took our messages seriously.”<br/>
<br/>
Toth merely raised an eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
“How could they not, when a chapter which has teetered half over the brink into corruption brings word of it once more?”<br/>
<br/>
There was the slightest hint of threat in his deep baritone. But then, that was present in most Inquisitor’s voices when it came to speaking to the Blood Ravens these days. An unfortunate truth.<br/>
<br/>
“You have risen from Captaincy, Gabriel,” Toth allowed, his free hand splaying to the side, “But it has been many years since we met last. Your previous Chapter Master and those who followed him…your Chapter’s actions in Kaurava…these are no small things. The Ordo Hereticus may have declared you and your remaining followers pure, but as we both know,” Toth somehow managed to loom despite their size disparity, “The predations of daemon-kind are a singularly virulent issue.”<br/>
<br/>
It was well that most of the Blood Ravens present wore their helms, for of them all, none had met Toth personally save Angelos and Thule, with only Angelos managing to gain his grudging respect. Here, then, was no space marine, just like so many others, who sneered at them. Shied away from them. Feared them, for things they had not done. All this they had suffered before, but few other than Inquisitors had the power to do something about it. The fires of Cyrene and Typhon Primaris had burned out long ago, but the burning of the shame that their destruction had been required at all would smolder forever in the heart of the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
“We do not disagree, Inquisitor Toth,” Gabriel finally said, his voice level despite the glower leveled at him by the Grey Knights and his once peer in battle. “Yet we have had multiple confirmations. The daemon known as Ulkair is beginning to rattle his cage once more. And seeing as we do not have the capabilities of…<i>repairing</i> a half-shattered planet,” he paused, almost expectantly to see if the Inquisitor had unearthed some long-lost lore or another to do exactly that before continuing, “We must prepare to battle him once more.”<br/>
<br/>
Toth stroked at his chin with his hand, glancing at the Chapter Master up and down, then at the rest of his brother marines.<br/>
<br/>
“The Ordo Malleus will investigate this, Chapter Master, but I will not promise anything more,” he stated firmly, hand raising to forestall the immediate protest. “I do not possess the capability <i>not</i> to doubt the Blood Ravens, given the circumstances, Angelos. But rest assured,” he paused, his tone growing almost sibilant with pious hatred, “<i>If</i> you speak truth, then the hammer will rise and <i>fall</i> upon this vile servant of Chaos with all the strength I can muster.”<br/>
<br/>
There was little more to be said than that. There was worry, to be certain, for the actions of the Inquisition upon populaces which grew more aware of Chaos was known to the astartes. But there was a hope that the sophistication of Angel Forge would keep such a thing from happening. The fact that Governor Derosa lived despite having ruled her world against the Chaos-tainted members of her own nobility and against the warband of the Pillager spoke to said hope.<br/>
<br/>
But, in truth, if the Ordo Malleus declared Meridian tainted beyond redemption, there would be little the Blood Ravens would be able to do to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
Such grim thoughts were left behind, however, as the Chapter’s fleet save for the 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company assembled once more and plunged into the warp. There was a war to fight. Battles to be won.<br/>
<br/>
An alien race to exterminate.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Ordo Malleus Leery Of Blood Ravens, But Cannot Afford To Dismiss Concerns. Toth + Grey Knights Investigating Subsector Now. If Definitive Proof Found, <u>Will</u> Respond. </b><br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">====================================================<br/>​</div>Various materials were carefully reviewed by the chapter while en route to the battlezone. For if there was nothing else the Ordo Xenos cared about, it was ensuring they could slay their foe of choice no matter what. Collected records by Deathwatch Kill Teams, Imperial Guard reports on combat, and Mechanicus studies of the foul xeno tech. All these and more were freely given by the hand of the Inquisitor Lord, for she cared little at this point about who was doing the killing so long as it was done, and done thoroughly. Speed factored as well, but there was something to be said about ensuring absolute victory through annihilation, words given by her own messages to the Blood Ravens. As such, for the first time in a long time, the Chapter had the capability of acting with careful measure as they had in the past, rather than simply rushing into the fight or having the fight thrust upon <i>them</i>.<br/>
<br/>
So. <br/>
<br/>
The Suyush Hives.<br/>
<br/>
They had come screaming out of the void upon their ships and descended with remarkable alacrity upon the Jahan System, of the Subsector Daro, of the Herepa Sector. Their ships have little in the way of long range fire capabilities, compared to Imperial vessels at least, but are consistently more than fast enough for them to adopt almost astartes-esque tactics. Rapid boarding, boring through the hull with whatever they call their xeno versions of assault rams, with ensuing slaughter of the crews. Part of the issue is that due to a quirk of their technologies, or perhaps by deliberate design, their vessels appear to be nothing more than spaceborne debris for the most part. Asteroids, meteors, and the like, without any of the obvious signs than an ork rok would give. Which let them get far too close before sensors registered that they were not, in fact, simple rocks.<br/>
<br/>
From the Jahan System, and utilizing its four planets and their vast mineral wealth, they have leapfrogged outwards throughout not just Daro but the rest of the Herepa Sector. This is attributed to their horrifyingly rapid reproduction rate – hatching within a month of laying and fully maturing within three months of said birth. Males grow throughout their lives until reaching some unknown cutoff point, terminating in Royal Guard xeno-forms. Said forms are of size and disturbingly toughness of a space marine dreadnought frame, while their Queens are their leadership and highest level military commanders, and given reports of the Deathwatch Kill Teams, are absolutely massive beings that can approach an Imperial Knight in size. Over three dozen worlds are currently being fought over, with the Suyush forces throughout the Herepa Sector gaining constant reinforcements thanks to their dominance of the Jahan System.<br/>
<br/>
From there, they have constructed shipyards and factories which endlessly create war material for the rest of their war effort – a disturbing xeno facsimile of a burgeoning Forge World more than anything else. This beachhead also allows them to bring in reinforcements from wherever their home is, unchallenged by the Imperium until now. This cannot be allowed to continue. The moment the system is sufficiently considered ‘reclaimed’ a specially brought together Imperial Navy task force will enter and enforce interdiction efforts. It is the hope that this will then choke off the rest of the Suyush forces throughout the sector, allowing the Imperial Guard to grind them down with Deathwatch aid. The simple fact of the matter is, the defenses entrenched in the Jahan System, coupled with the presence of Queens on multiple other worlds throughout Herepa, they don’t have enough astartes for the assassination missions required – especially due to the vehement defense the Royal Guard put up whenever their charges are threatened.<br/>
<br/>
But you do.<br/>
<br/>
Of significant note is this, about the Jahan System in particular.<br/>
<br/>
These four mining worlds possess extremely rare and valuable rare metals and materials which are used for the particular alloys required to craft the hulls of space marine starships, nova cannon shells, cyclonic torpedoes, and more besides. The refining facilities present on the planet have likely been either destroyed or irreparably tainted by xeno hands, which will require Mechanicus work to restore. But doing so is considerably more preferable compared to losing access to such materials entirely. Perhaps more frustrating is that the Suyush ‘engineers’, even they can even be called that, have begun using said rare materials to aid in the construction of their own lacking vessels and war material. This, too, must be stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Records granted to you have indicated that the Jahan System, due to its valuable nature, was granted access to a plethora of defensive stations, all of which have been taken over by the reptilian race for their own purposes. Each of the four planets, Kuru, Matsya, Avanti, and Vatsa, have four orbital defense stations above them. More centrally located in the system between the four planets is the enormous space station <i>Sacred Crown</i>, which was formerly used as a transport hub for the constant shipments in and out of the system that once took place. It was also the Imperial Navy’s command and control center for the entire system, including links to the orbital stations and other defenses upon the planets below. It is unknown how intact said links are, as there is evidence that the crew of the station sabotaged it significantly once they realized they were going to lose the station to the alien. Certainly it still remains, used in its original purpose yet by xeno hands, and both the Imperial Navy and Mechanicus desire it – and the other orbital stations – back, though they understand if they are in fact destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
What matters is getting the worlds back.<br/>
<br/>
Suyush ground forces follow a linear progression. Clawborn are their basic infantry, having reached physical maturity. They are of base human size in height, though they hunch down further and make use of torso-mounted ranged weaponry for such combat while relying on their claws and melee weapons for close range. This has proven more than enough for them to tear apart Imperial guardsmen in one on one combat, their naturally tough hides near equivalent to flak armor. Bloodscales, those who have survived longer, take on a reddish tent to their hides, growing stronger and are capable of wielding heavy weapons. While their non-heat based weaponry is more primitive, more stubbers than anything else, their larger heat cannons are capable of melting holes in tank armor given a few seconds of sustained fire. Following this are the Hungerers, their true elites, who have grown to a size and bulk of ogryns, with far more intelligence. In combat they wield enormous ‘heat-blades’ which are capable of releasing enough heat to carve apart whole layers of steel, or dual heat-cannons mounted upon their torsos.<br/>
<br/>
More specialized troops include stalkers, dimunitive Suyush who appear built for scouting and infiltration duty, and void screamers, their version of psykers. Their vehicle pool includes fang tanks, which have reliably shown a ratio of success of two fang tanks to one Leman Russ, and have a swappable vehicle layout to grant them various tactical capabilities on the battlefield – from long range heat emitters, close range ‘blast-wave’ heat weaponry, and so on. In turn, their aircraft are for the most part the omni-fighter VTOLs classified as ‘scream claws’. At the least, scream claws have shown the ability to be bombers as well as dog fighters. These latter two have proven to be a major threat to the armor of the Imperial Guard, and factories producing them should be given priority over more simple infantry munitions.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted at this point that the Suyush appear to be after one thing only, in their conquests, beyond simple territory.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, they are after food.<br/>
<br/>
Though they are not tyranids, they have shown a total acceptance of cannibalism and are eager to get into melee combat precisely so they can devour whole swathes of infantry. It is theorized that the main reason they escalated from mere raids on Imperial territory to full invasion was a combination of overpopulation and food crisis, issues they have solved by using humans as cattle. There are more than enough pict-recordings of their ‘larders’ discovered in certain hives after a queen’s retreat or death to give credence to this. Their entire race is wholly carnivorous, completely ignoring vegetable-based sustenance possibilities. Citizenry of the Imperium are seen as nothing more than food for them, regardless of standing, importance. This cannot stand, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
As for the planets of the system, the more of the original Imperial foundries, refineries, and mining complexes that remained intact, the better for the Imperium. As such, while orbital bombardment was authorized, it was patently requested that the Blood Ravens avoid overuse on more valuable pieces of infrastructure that could be reclaimed later. Total extermination of every single Suyush was not required, rather just strategic defeat, major removal of all major and minor production facilities, reclamation or destruction of orbital stations and the <i>Sacred Crown</i>, absolute destruction of Suyush shipyards, and the death of all Suyush Queens present within the system to ensure no constantly growing reinforcements. It is known that there are at least 10 Suyush Slayers – cruiser tonnage vessels – within the system, along with one Queen-helmed Scorchnest Battleship with requisite escorts. While their vessels have consistently shown to be faster than most Imperial Navy ships, they do not quite reach the same tier of speed that the Blood Ravens could push their ships to. As for the <i>Sacred Crown </i>itself, based on Deathwatch information gained from data cast intercepts, there is a Queen present there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Another important note, gained through the sacrifice of three different Kill Teams, is that destruction of a Queen does <i>not</i> ensure orkoid anarchy as when a Warboss dies. Rather, the Suyush within a several mile radius frenzy in an attempt to kill the one who fired the last shot or swung the final stroke of the blade, somehow tracking through either psychic pulse or irremovable pheromones. To the point that most all stealth procedures are incapable of masking those who slew the Queen. Any who slay the Queens must be retrieved immediately or be overwhelmed by hundreds to thousands of fearless reptiles who suddenly lose the ability to feel pain…or, perhaps, simply weather the reprisal. Those who survive or are extracted are then forever marked elsewhere, the Suyush recognizing a Queen’s killers even on different planets, which requires its own tactical considerations. Luckily, this tracking only seems to extend to whoever struck the final blow, somehow.<br/>
<br/>
With all of this information, Gabriel knew that the Blood Ravens could produce a framework for the upcoming campaign that they could properly commit themselves to.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><b>Organize Blood Raven Reclamation Campaign</b><br/>
Note: After each phase, there will be a vote to continue ‘as planned’ or to modify operational framework depending on successes or failures, etc. Thus, all things beyond the 'initial' phase are just rough estimations, and can be refined after said initial phase. So don't worry about them <i>too</i> much.​</div><u> <br/>
Strategic Path For Initial Phase (Choose 1)</u><br/>
[] <b>Reclamation First</b>: Assault and board the <i>Sacred Crown</i>, reclaim it for the Emperor, then defend against the obvious Suyush void-based reprisal. Attempt to destroy all Suyush ships, either through aggressive boarding procedures, allowing them to re-board the station and kill them there, outright ramming, etc. up to Hadrian’s discretion as Master of the Fleet. It will allow the ground forces warning to begin fortifying defensively, but it will hopefully not matter to the Blood Ravens in the long run. On the other hand, the longer they control the void, the easier it will be for them to reinforce from space. Thus, the sooner this is done, the better.<br/>
[] <b>Push And Dance</b>: They cannot match the Blood Ravens for speed, so don’t let them catch up. Aggressively push towards each of the four planets, or just one, and drop off Blood Raven forces to begin immediate reprisal operations – destruction of enemy population centers, factories, etc. – while the fleet will peel away and commit to long-term and long-range combat against the enemy fleet to keep the foe from their own orbital bombardments. Avoid orbital space stations, shipyards, and the <i>Sacred Crown</i> for now. (Write-In Which Planet Gets Which Forces [Kuru, Matsya, Avanti, and Vatsa])<br/>
[] <b>Divide And Conquer: </b>Perform elements of both of the above plans, with Blood Raven ships deploying certain elements elsewhere. Conquer the station, but also deploy astartes to one or more of the enemy planets. A daring maneuver, but one that if successful would shorten the campaign statistically. It would mean greater difficulty in either operation due to less brothers associated with each, but is not one astartes capable of a great amount? (Write-In Which Planet Gets Which Forces/Write-In Which Forces Assault <i>Sacred Crown</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Strategic Path For Next Phase [Orbital Bombardment Automatic When All Immediate Void/Orbital Threats Neutralized]</u><br/>
<i>Orbital/Void</i> [Choose One]<br/>
[] <b>Retake</b>: Work to retake the four orbital defense platforms over each of the planets through boarding. Destroy all xeno shipyards. Destroy all enemy ships, one way or another. (Write-In Which Planet Gets Which Ships, Or Go In Clump From Planet To Planet)<br/>
[] <b>Destroy</b>: Do not risk your brothers, simply destroy the orbital defense platforms over each of the planets alongside the xeno shipyards. Destroy all enemy ships, one way or another. (Write-In Which Planet Gets Which Ships, Or Go In Clump From Planet To Planet)<br/>
<i>Ground Targets</i><br/>
[] <b>Top</b>: Forgo all other targets but the Queens. Track them down where they hide, deep within the mines, and slay them then and there. Total organizational chaos amongst the enemy will result…as well as absolute xeno frenzy in attempting to kill the killers. (Write-In Forces Contributed To This)<br/>
[] <b>Middle</b>: Focus on destroying vehicular factories and depots, from tanks to artillery to aircraft. There will be obvious significant infantry resistance to this. (Write-In Forces Contributed To This)<br/>
[] <b>Bottom</b>: Focus on destroying all Suyush infantry-based targets, from barracks, supply depots, training facilities, and so on. There will be significant vehicular resistance to this. (Write-In Forces Contributed To This)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Next Phase</u><br/>
<i>Orbital/Void [</i>Do not necessarily need to split forces, can choose one over the others]<br/>
[] <b>Interdict</b>: It is certain that Suyush ships are going to be attempting to reclaim what you’ve taken, or aid their fellows regardless. They must be halted and torn apart before they can do anything in-system. Whether these will be coming from where the Suyush are from, or returning from other battlezones, or both.  But there is no way to be certain how many these will be. (Write-In Ships Contributed to This)<br/>
[] <b>Continued Bombardment:</b> Some ships may need to remain over the planets to rapidly increase the ability of the brothers on the ground to complete their objectives one way or another. Plus the ability to land Thunderhawks and the like to move troops around even faster. (Write-In Ships Contributed to This)<br/>
