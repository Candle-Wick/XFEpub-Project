<b><i><u>Van Hal:</u></i></b> "Ah. Weber. Come in. Come in. So. Have you found out found out who's been conspiring against us yet?"<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde: </i></u></b>"Well, your grace, I've been doing some digging and um..."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "What? What is it?"<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "It's...It's everyone, sir."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "What do you mean, everyone?<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "I mean everyone! Literally everyone in this castle is part of some ancient conspiracy or other, and has been for centuries!<br/>
The gate guards are all in the pocket of the Von Carsteins, but they keep feuding with the wall guards, who are all under the thumb of the Blood Dragons. The cleaners are all part of a Slaaneshi cult, the cooks are all Nurgleites, your valet's a Tzeenchian sorcerer and the townsfolk are currently taking bets over whether they'll be part of the Skaven conspiracy the Dark Elven one. The Greatswords are all sworn to the Tomb Kings, except for the one weirdo who's conspiring with Malal. Heck, even the choir boys in the chapel are actually just a bunch of very poorly-disguised goblins who wanted to know what all the fuss was about. We have, in short, achieved 100% Ancient Conspiracy Saturation."<br/>
<br/>
<b><i><u>Van Hal</u></i></b>: "By Sigmar! Then we must act now! Raise the alarm! Raise the-"<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "Not so fast, your grace. You see, it turns out that, while all the conspiracies are technically against you, they actually hate each other more than they dislike you. Over the many centuries that this has gone on, they've developed a kind of...equilibrium. Everybody here may want you dead, but none of the conspiracies wants the other ones to be the one to take all the glory doing so. So the entire castle is made up of conspiracies to kill you conspiring against <i>other </i>conspiracies to kill you. It all balances out, see."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "So in other words, I'm..."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "You're actually the safest man in all the Empire, so long as you don't disturb any of the conspiring factions here. Yes. This whole place is like a bunch of archstones all keeping themselves in balance. It's silly, but there you are."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "And what about yesterday's incident?"<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "Well, your grace. It turns out that was actually a very foolish Lahmian. Thought she could make a name for herself by barging in here and causing a ruckus. Pissed off quite a few people doing it, too."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "So what happened to her?"<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde:</i></u></b> "Well I had intended to apprehend her, but it turns out she'd suffered a very tragic accident. She was in one of the towers combing her hair, when she tragically slipped, fell down the tower stairs and fell on her sword. On the way down she'd also fallen into *pulls up notes* Sixteen spears, fifty-three daggers, nine bullets (normal), three bullets (silver), Five jars containing Nurgle's Rot, Twenty-three ghouls, two stray warpfire blasts and one very lost Arachnorok. It's all quite sad, really."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Van Hal</i></u></b>: "Oh..."<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><i>Mathilde</i></u></b>: "Anyway, I'm off. I heard we're having spider stew tonight, and I sugest you don't look at it too closely. Ta-ta!"</div>
