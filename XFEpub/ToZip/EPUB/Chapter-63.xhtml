    <h2>Turn 17: Inch By Bloody Inch</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: left">GM NOTE: Short, compared to other turn posts, but there just isn't that much to be said, you know?<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: center"><b>Inch By Bloody Inch<br/>
+020.M42+ To +025.M42+<br/>
+<i>A Foe Without Honour Is A Foe Already Beaten.</i>+</b><br/>​</div>It has been a hard fought five years against the daemons of the warp. But it is undeniable that progress has been made. With each specialized Gellar field generator, the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i> twists and shudders as it is forced into reality further and further. The immaterium which has drenched it for so long is being steadily forced back. Vast forge ships from Zerann and Aerus float about its great bulk, each massive vessel already practically the size of a regular battle barge on its own yet with far more of them unequipped with weaponry so much as their incredibly sophisticated internal forge systems. With the coldest precision and most unforgiving of logic do the servants of the Omnissiah tear away those parts of the space hulk which are of clear xeno-nature while smoothing out the lines and partitions between its various component parts. Ever so slowly, as more of the warp is pushed back, are they transforming the unpredictably shifting space hulk instead into something more worthy of their God.<br/>
<br/>
But the fight is being won, if with extreme work. After so much constant exertion of their skitarii and own military power within the past few years, it is unlikely that the Mechanicus within Korianis will be capable of committing to much more for some time. Operations as Aerus or this will be rare for a time. Part of you is thankful, at the thought that in the future the Blood Ravens might be able to move forward and fight other foes beyond just Korianis itself. Perhaps. But such thoughts are not uncommon on the <i>Carrion</i>, for its blood-soaked and rusted corridors are morose in turn. There are brighter moments of course, that the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company has returned, bloodied and successful with new battle brothers to join your ranks. Even as you battle within, that does not prevent you from leading the Chapter itself. Indeed, there is regular and required times for all to be removed from the space hulk lest it bring taint into your bodies, minds, and souls. It is something that even the Mechanicus knows for true, given the amount of their own servitors and skitarii which mutate and turn against them if given too much long-term exposure. Hadrian has recovered from his wounds, and the rest of the Chapter remains to be lead for the future.<br/>

- 2 Gladius Frigates Delivered To Chapter, To Be Assigned.<br/>
- Test-Slave Harvest Completes From Turn 16. 30 Gene-Seed Implanted In <b>020.M42. Harvest Gains +60 Gene-Seed</b>.<br/>
- <b>Chapter Fleet Repairs Complete!</b> 1 Battle Barge, <i>Scientia Est Potentia,</i> 2 Strike Cruisers,<i> The Great Father's Fist and Burning Seeker, </i>have returned to service!<br/>
- Research complete!  Chief Apothecary Gracchus's studies have born fruit! There should be fewer implantation-based deaths or failures now amongst our 10th Company. In the future, it will be more up to whether or not they capable of surviving battle than their own bodies failing them. <b>Small boost to implantation survivability.</b><br/>
- The return of the Scientia Est Potentia and its unique forge systems known as the <i>Forge Potentia</i> allows for the Mk-VII Power Armor to be made as standard armaments, due to the powerful and advanced systems therein, ensuring that they will not have to be made to-order per every new battle brother. <b>Mk-VII 'Aquila' Power Armor Is Now Standard Armament, No Longer Requires Tracking In Armory.</b><br/>
- As a result of the recent consistent aid and work done alongside the Adeptus Mechanicus, it could be perceived that your relations have improved! Somewhat.<br/>

<u>Lead Your Chapter (All Technically Available):</u><br/>
[] Further Black Crusade Contributions – Send forces to aid in the Black Crusade, even though Aramus’s presence apparently counts enough for some. (Write-In)<br/>
[] Recall Brothers In The Deathwatch<br/>
- (Specify In Write-In)<br/>
[] Hunting Down Vandis - Vandis has fled further into the Segmentum Ultima. He is a cultist, a heretic, and a purveyor of that which is yours. Each of these is an individual death sentence, but all three at once demands the most violent of retributions towards him. Yet, to leave the Sector behind is a major decision for your forces, who have up until now remained within Sector Korianis as you rebuild your strength. Not only this, but he could be dead for all you know, meaning that it would be a meaningless excursion of your forces when there yet remain threats within Sector Korianis. (Write-In Forces Sent Out If Desired)<br/>
[] Promote 5th Chapter Veterans To 1st Company. (Write-In Amount)<br/>
[] Assign your newest 45 Battle Brothers to:<br/>
-[] The 5th Company (Write-In Amount)<br/>
-[] The 4th Company, to be re-established under Hadrian, thereby ensuring your ships will possess far more than simple serfs and servitors to defend them. (Write-In Amount)<br/>
[] Assign the 2 new Gladius-class Frigates within the Chapter Fleet (Write-In)<br/>
[] Assign the Battle Barge <i>Scientia Est Potentia </i>within the Chapter Fleet. (Write-In)<br/>
[] Assign the 2 Strike Cruisers,<i> The Great Father's Fist </i>and<i> Burning Seeker </i>within the Chapter Fleet (Write-In)<br/>
[] Derosa's Debt - A thought, suggested to you by Martellus, is to make use of the massive and sophisticated Angel Forge facilities to construct a number of thunderhawks for the Chapter. This was an idea brought about the fact that you may indeed require defense against void-based foes in the future. Her continued gratitude and thankfulness for the work of the Chapter in saving her life personally, the planet of Meridian, and more with Subsector Aurelia, makes for it a more than likely possibility. Even beyond the usage of the Angel Forge you currently possess. (Exchange 1 Major Derosa's Debt Favor for Angel Forge to produce 16 Thunderhawks, of Gunship or Transporter Variety. Write-In Particulars)<br/>
[] Inquire as to aid that can be given to Derosa (Potential for options that may or may not garner Minor or Major favors)<br/>

The Blood Ravens have lost so many, both fresh blood and veteran. It may aid in the rebuilding of the Chapter for you to work upon them and try to impart the skill and experience that the Blood Ravens of the past once possessed. [Toughness Characteristic Has Reached Its Cap And Can No Longer Be Selected]<br/>
<br/>
[] Select Main Characteristic (1d100+Trainer)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher<br/>
<br/>
[] Select Two Secondary Characteristics (1d50+Trainer Each)<br/>
- [] Specify Teacher(s)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos, Chief Librarian Probalis, and Apollo are mighty champions and <i>can</i> be deployed on operations. They need not remain in their ships doing nothing. To have them participate in an operation, it <b>must</b> be specified that they do so.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Nero Gracchus – Chief Apothecary (Choose 2):</u><br/>
[] Implant Test-Slaves with Gene-Seed to harvest in 5 years. Write-In the amount of Gene-Seed you wish to use.<br/>
[] Implant Neophytes [2nd Stage]/ Psyker Neophyte [2nd Stage] with Gene-Seed. (21 Total)<br/>
[] Write-In<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus</u><br/>
- The Apothecarium is growing well, the trainees and graduates are a good boon to my efforts. I may even be able to focus all of my efforts on studying our gene-seed soon.<br/>
- The <i>Potentia</i> has returned? Good. The <i>Arcanum</i> may have had the largest of our Apothecarium, but it was the <i>Potentia</i> that possessed the most advanced, as befitting its name. This should aid in the works of the Apothecarium for its purposes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Justinius Probalis - Chief Librarian (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Request to recruit and train potential psyker aspirants from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica<br/>
[] Begin in-depth studies of the remains of the various eldar Avatars of Khaine possessed by the Chapter [Note: This will mean that all non-Chapter Epistolary Librarians and Justinius Probalis are <b>unusable </b>for other tasks for <b>2 </b>turns i.e. 10 years.]<br/>
[] Study what was retrieved from the Dark Eldar Anchorage Command Center for anything useful, and to log it within the Librarius for later perusal if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider - Justinius Probalis</u><br/>
- The latest combat against the daemons of the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i> has made me think on the daemonhammer that the Chapter Master wields. We could, perhaps, use more of such weapons. It was created using a shard of the weapon of an Avatar. Perhaps we could make some ourselves, if we studied it enough?<br/>
- The Chapter's greatest advantage was its Librarians. I know that they were used for...ill purpose in the past by Kyras, but I will not allow such a political character to be assigned to them ever again. We were meant for more than that. For the betterment of the Chapter, for its coming battles, and the maintenance of the <i>Sanctorium Arcanum,</i> we must rebuild our ranks, and soon.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Martellus Ravias – Master of the Forge (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Build Order (525 BP Available)<br/>
[] Improve the Forges Of<br/>
-[] The <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> [0/1000] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
-[] The <i>Litany Of Fury</i> [0/750] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
-[] The <i>Burning Seeker</i> [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
[] Construct Forge Facilities On Company Flagships (Current/Former)<br/>
- [] The <i>Faith's Horizon</i> [0/500] to recieve an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
- [] The <i>Howling Hatred</i> [0/500] to receive an additional +50 BP/Turn<br/>
[] Study The Rapier For Potential Learning Of Design To Allow Replication (WARNING: May end up losing some Rapiers as a result of the study) [50/???]<br/>
[] Study The Hrud Fusils For ???? (Warning: May end up losing some Fusils as a result of the study) [0/????]<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of the Forge Ravias</u><br/>
- I could use a few more peers in the forges. Or at least subordinates.<br/>
- The Forges could use improvement, I think. It is not blasphemy against the Omnissiah to improve what facilities we have, increase their capacity and sophistication.<br/>
- We should work to ensure that our ships possess Thunderhawks or some form of strike craft at the least in abundance for defensive and offensive purposes in void and planetary-combat. Especially if we plan on our ships engaging in such in the near future!<br/>
- Thank goodness the <i>Potentia</i> has returned to service. Amongst the rest of the ships within the Chapter Fleet, it possesses the most advanced forge facilities, as befitting its name. This will surely aid me in construction of more advanced technologies in the future, as well as their study!<br/>
- THE RAPIER! Praise be to the Omnissiah! It is as if a Tarantula Turret which can move and maneuver, greatly increasing its chances of survival! Please, Chapter Master, allow me to study it, to learn its secrets, so that the design is not lost should they be destroyed!<br/>
- Hrud Fusils are prizes indeed. It is said they are an extremely advanced example of symbiosis between melta and plasma weaponry. I could attempt to study them, and discover if they may inspire further secrets of the Omnissiah in their nature - though surely not as if I would be committing to xeno tech-heresy. Obviously.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Cyrus Octavius – Master of Recruits (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Enact Blood Trials Upon The Four Of Your Viable Recruiting Worlds (Calderis/Trontiux III/Meridian/Junius) And Train Those Who Survive<br/>
[] Something Else (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of Recruits</u><br/>
- The only thing that can truly help the 10th Company is time, dedicated time, to train your initiates, neophytes, and scouts.<br/>
- With the arrival of many experienced 1st Company Sergeants, more Blood Trials can be enacted without Cyrus' direct observation.<br/>​</div></div>
