<b>Ashen Flight<br/>
+050.M42+ To +055.M42+<br/>
+<i>To The End, Always+</i></b><br/>​</div>It took precious, precious time for the Mechanicus arrive, but thankfully the warp currents were kind. Whether this was because they were following behind the hunting ships, simply ready and waiting for Gabriel to message them, or something else, he did not know. There was of course some minor suspicion, that if they had in fact merely been just out of range they could have joined in. But he did not have time for such paranoia, not right now, in the middle of this. Besides which, he was already doing this in an effort to improve relations with the Mechanicus within the sector, as well as work towards replenishing the weak Blood Raven Fleet. In any case, a sizable Mechanicus War Fleet eventually did show up, leaving a number of powerful Mechanicus cruisers behind to guard the bounty the Chapter had managed to claim. Only once that deployment was done did the Archmagos in charge initiate contact.<br/>
<br/>
This Archmagos Veneratus, a high ranking station indeed, is almost entirely metal. Gabriel could not, in fact, discern a single scrap of visible flesh upon their modified frame. Even their voice was wholly androgynous and without any tone, a flat mechanical voice with an underlying buzz from the advanced vocoder which covered their throat and the lower half of their face. There was no sign of open weaponry, but Gabriel knew better than to underestimate one who had reached the rank this priest had.<br/>
<br/>
“Greetings, Archmagos,” Gabriel spoke from the bridge of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>. “Thank you for arriving so quickly…and with such a mighty fleet.”<br/>
<br/>
“Greetings, Chapter Master Angelos. I am the Archmagos Veneratus in command of these noble machines. My name is Derillion. Phokas sends his regards,” they bowed at the waist, causing the hololith image to wobble shakily.<br/>
<br/>
Derillion then drew up the auspex scans of the ships which even now were being corralled by the Mechanicus cruisers, various notations appearing to speak of the damage dealt to them.<br/>
<br/>
“This is quite a wealth of ships for us to study and tear apart,” Derillion stated emotionlessly, “Though their condition could be better…yes, this will do.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is inevitable that some damage would be dealt,” Gabriel reminded them, “Eldar do not surrender easily.”<br/>
<br/>
Five hands raise up in a conciliatory gesture, metal palms facing him. Upon the tech priest’s back, three more heavy mechadendrites wriggled back and forth, visible even to Gabriel through the transmission.<br/>
<br/>
“Peace, Chapter Master, I meant no disrespect. I have fought in the Basilikon Astra for over a century. Unlike some of my colleagues, I know the difficulty of what you have been asked.”<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel raised an eyebrow at Derillion before nodding.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well. If there is nothing else?”<br/>
<br/>
Derillion paused before slowly shaking his head.<br/>
<br/>
“Just one matter, Angelos. A wealth of ships you have captured, but none in as good condition as we had hoped. When we locate the eldar once more, I would request that – if at all possible – that you capture vessels as whole as possible, rather than by number. One fully intact vessel is worth much more than many broken.”<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel pursed his lips.<br/>
<br/>
“If possible,” Derillion stressed. “Do not sacrifice the ancient vessels under your command, it would be sacrilege to force them unto destruction.”<br/>
<br/>
“Very well, Archmagos,” Gabriel murmured, before raising his voice. “Let the hunt begin.”<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">===================================<br/>​</div>A bare slip of concentration, and now the Blood Ravens had them. The journey is a fierce one, not because of being attacked by eldar, but by the simple dint of where they fled to. It is something that only became apparent as the fleet left the edges of the system, and were forced to venture even further beyond. For the Eldar Corsairs which have so battered the Sector in recent years have come from none other than beyond the border of the Imperium itself. It made a sort of sense, Gabriel knew, that they would flee so far, have their base so distant. The light from the Astronomicon itself becomes a flickering and worrisome thing the further one must extend the hunt, but in this, the eldar have erred. Against a normal Imperial fleet, they might have been forced to turn back, the warp currents growing more turbulent, the light from Terra growing too dim for proper long jumps through the warp. Even the Mechanicus vessels are forced to close with the Blood Raven’s own ships, coming closer and closer for aid of joined astropathic power. Even Derillion seems uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
But the Great Father provided.<br/>
<br/>
The Sanctorium Arcanum blazes with power, the <i>Litany of Fury</i> travelling at the exact center of the entire formation. The Librarian ranks are not as powerful as they once were, or as numerous. But they can yet do this. The incredible creation of Azariah Vidya boosts the light of the Emperor into full bloom once more, allowing the fleets to travel in pursuit. All the while, Brother Damion knelt upon the bridge of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>, psychic energies rippling through the air about him. Even with his eyes shut, it is as if he has replaced his sight with the stars themselves, so brightly do the burn from behind his eyelids. His psychic hood strains and whines from the stress being put under it, but he does not relent. None of the Blood Ravens would.<br/>
<br/>
The corsairs had – for years and years – slaughtered multiple regiments of PDF, raided depots, destroyed stations for defense and supply. Good men of the Imperial Navy, Imperial Guard, and thousands more citizens of the Imperium have suffered under the blades of these xenos, for whatever reason. Profit and plunder? Or something perhaps more involved given their raiding of the former Maiden Worlds that are now within the Emperor’s sight? In truth, it did not matter. No excuse for what they’ve done would stay the wrath of the Blood Ravens, nor the cold calculations of the Mechanicus.<br/>
<br/>
Through their Webway they have fled, not daring to risk the warp, too cowardly to even try.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, as the warp travel terminated, their flight was proven for naught.<br/>
<br/>
None of the records speak of this system beyond the Imperium’s light, though even Justinius knew it was long shot. A solar system with naught but one massive gas giant orbiting a massive red star. And around that gas giant? The foe, a Haven Spire, bristling with weaponry and shielding. Its solar sails were fully flared, but even as the ships were finishing their arrival in system, every ship successfully exiting in time with the pulses of the Sanctorum, they were closing. It is a curious thing, a brighter mirror to the station that the Dark Eldar once possessed, before the chapter destroyed it of course. And around it flocks the rest of the Eldar Fleet. In the very center, clearly in the middle of being repaired, was the Void Stalker from before. Yet, to the side, slightly separate from all of these, were another small amount of eldar vessels. But these, these bore markings that Gabriel knew well. That all the Blood Ravens knew well. For those additional ships bore the mark of the Craftworld Biel-Tan.<br/>
<br/>
Communications with Derillion open immediately.<br/>
<br/>
“We’ve caught them in system, Chapter Master,” the Archamagos’ voice is louder, if as without inflection as before. “We must move quickly before more can escape – capture or destruction of the Haven Spire is paramount!”<br/>
<br/>
"Beware the ships of Biel-Tan, Archmagos, they are likely to be even more dangerous than the Corsairs," Gabriel interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
"We will! But now then, to the fight! Glory to the Omnissiah, and the Imperium!"<br/>
<br/>
With that, the hololith cut out.<br/>
<br/>
The eldar vessels were already deploying, the Void Stalker joining its brethren despite not being fully repaired. Their solar sails opened wide, the closeness of the sun providing more than enough energy for their engines. In the same instant, the Basilikon ships were assembling into their own defensive charge formation. Of course. There seemed to be an excess of particularly excitable and warlike Mechanicus leadership in Sector Korianis. His bionic lungs did not necessarily need to sigh, but Gabriel did it anyway, stomping over to where Captain Hadrian sat, connected already with the rest of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i>.<br/>
<br/>
“Orders, Chapter Master?”<br/>
<br/>
He asked, but there was that eagerness still, the aggression by which Hadrian was steadily becoming known for more and more in the Chapter.<br/>
<br/>
“We destroy the xenos, Brother-Captain,” Gabriel gave the grim pronouncement.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well,” Hadrian grinned, fists clenching against the command throne. “All ships, move out!”<br/>
<br/>
Archmagos Derillion’s ships burned bright in the void in their eagerness to join with the foe, distant lance fire already ranging out from their battleships. Ranges that Gabriel had never seen Imperial Navy vessels manage before, in point of fact, but that is but a matter of course for the worshippers of the Omnissiah. In turn, the eldar spread out into a wide formation indeed, knowing that they could not defeat the Basilikon in a stand-up fight ship to ship. Instead, they appeared to be trying to take advantage of the speed of their ships, trying to flank and perhaps even reach the rear of Gabriel's allies and attack from there. Yet, certain ships remained, demanding forward attention even then, among them the two Void Stalker battleships. Near these were elements of the Biel-Tan fleet, clustered about the Haven Spire like insects defending the hive.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center"><u>Phase 3 Decisions:</u>​</div><div style="text-align: left"><b>Deployment Directions For Phase 3</b>​</div>[] Flanking Prevention Allotment: Numerous eldar ships are attempting to flank the onrushing Basilikon ships, and must be countered. Among these are a great many of the enemy frigates and destroyers, relying on their speed to let them get into firing position. This must be stopped as Derillion’s ships continue towards the Haven Spire and the Void Stalker ships. [Write-In Forces Allotted To This]<br/>
[] Forward Assault Allotment: The strongest enemy vessels remain in forward position, with the Haven Spire at their backs providing its own firepower and miscellaneous defensive systems to the fight. The Basilikon vessels are rushing for this fight, for the quicker the Haven Spire is destroyed the sooner the enemy loses the ability to repair their vessels, continue to engage in piracy in the system, and who knows what else. Additional Shadow-class Cruisers are present here as well, along with two Eclipse-class, dangerous in their ability to rapidly deploy fighter-craft. [Write-In Forces Allotted To This]<br/>

AND<br/>
<br/>
<b>Chapter Focus For Phase 3</b><br/>
[] Focus On Boarding For Capture: It could be said that the entire point of this venture, aside from serving the Imperium, is to capture as many vessels in as intact a status as possible. This is the offer of the Mechanicus, and for the Blood Ravens to to fail in it would mean that they have lost brothers and ships for nothing. This is all to replenish the fleet. Yet, to focus wholly on this would be dangerous indeed, to brothers and what ships the chapter still possesses. Both in holding for boarders, and the actual boarding.<br/>
OR<br/>
[] Focus On Destruction: You have captured enough ships for the Mechanicus, and need not capture more. It would risk too many brothers, and what ships you possess, to do so. In this scale of battle, there can be no surety but in the total destruction of the enemy. It is an unnecessary risk. Better to destroy what ships the enemy has, to crush them, and end this threat to the Imperium here and now, utterly!<br/>
