While you would prefer to put some priority on securing every vessel that the Blood Ravens have remaining you simply do not have the manpower to do such things. You will likely not have the manpower to perform an actual long-term campaign barring matters that threaten the Imperium as a whole for quite some time remaining. The ever glowing embers of hatred and spite in your heart for the dread powers of Chaos nearly ignite in that moment of silent contemplation before you begin speaking again. The Magos would prefer you be quick about your business and you see no reason to ignore his request.<br/>
<br/>
“We will pledge forces towards intervening on the matters of Trontiux II and the securing of Aerus. A new Forgeworld can only better bolster the Mechanicus throughout the Sector and beyond.”<br/>
<br/>
“While securing Trontiux II may aid in ensuring that no orkish incursions from one world to your Recruiting World occur either, hmm?” The Magos tilts his head and there is a ghost of bemusement in his tone but surely one so mechanized as he would not speak in such a manner.<br/>
<br/>
“There need be no ulterior motive to destroying the foul xenos which infest the galaxy, but your words have merit Magos Foratus,” you utter eventually, giving a single respectful bow of your head.<br/>
<br/>
“And in turn,” Foratus says gravely “We shall initiate Repair Rites upon the <i>Burning Seeker, Howling Hatred, </i>and <i>The Great Father’s Fist</i>. May the Omnissiah watch over you Chapter Master Angelos.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Emperor protects, but there is one other matter I would speak on with you,” you say then, your mind turning to the one other matter remaining with Subsector Aurelia.<br/>
<br/>
“The Space Hulk, the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i>, yes,” Foratus pre-empts you, raising a hand to forestall your prepared words on the damnable thing. “We know of the extreme troubles the Hulk has caused for your people. Know this, and I speak with the full authority of the Mechanicus in this matter,” he tilts his head again while several of his many optics whine as they readjust. “It may or may not be prudent to dismantle it, but your recent discovery of the ancient cogitator within by the one known as Aramus has refocused out our belief to further investigate it.”<br/>
<br/>
Something must have shown on your suddenly stony face for the Magos begins speaking again.<br/>
<br/>
“But we would not try to bleed your chapter any further, Chapter Master, we are not so foolish. Zerann is willing to negotiate for full ownership over the Space Hulk – and take on the responsibility of clearing and salvage efforts from the Blood Ravens.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is it not Terminator Squads that are brought forth to deal with such things,” you cannot help but allow some measure of doubt enter your voice.<br/>
<br/>
“<i>Often</i>, but it is not a required edict,” Foratus insists, even his flat voice producing an almost manic hunger. “We have many yet Skitarii that we can put forth.”<br/>
<br/>
“I see.”<br/>
<br/>
“In turn…,” the Magos says almost offhand, “We would count it is a great favor to us. Chapter Master Kyras refused to negotiate on such matters throughout his entire career despite repeated attempts to let us examine it carefully.”<br/>
<br/>
“Truly?”<br/>
<br/>
Kyras may have screamed the Blood God’s name unto death but by this point the weavings and plots and measures he took are far more reminiscent of the Changer of Ways if you are honest.<br/>
<br/>
“Indeed,” Foratus nods rapidly, “But perhaps…you are more open to our offer?”<br/>
<br/>
A great favor, obviously couched in the terms of your previous negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
“If we were to do such a thing, to grant the Mechanicus all rights to the <i>Judgement of Carrion</i>, would this not require-,”<br/>
<br/>
“A strong Mechanicus presence within Subsector Aurelia, yes,” Foratus nods again, his metallic frame jostling with the strength of it. “A fleet, to be specific. One of our Explorator Fleets is not quite yet ready to depart and yet it could quite easily make the time to study such a wondrous thing.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would not call that Space Hulk wondrous, Magos,” your disapproval for his near slavering is just barely kept out of your voice.<br/>
<br/>
“The <i>Judgement of Carrion</i> is the only Space Hulk in known Imperium Space to make such a consistent pattern of jumps, Chapter Master,” Foratus replies, his voice only suggesting condescension but not truly putting any weight behind it.<br/>
<br/>
You tire of these words bedecked in extra meaning.<br/>
<br/>
“If we were, would you consent to the worth of our negotiations being enough for repairing the Scientia Est Potentia?”<br/>
<br/>
Foratus does not possess a mouth anymore, but you swear you can sense him give you one.<br/>
<br/>
“Why yes, Chapter Master, indeed it would…”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================================================​</div> <br/>
It would have been simple for you to negotiate this sort of thing by way of vox cast but some things require face-to-face communications even in this day and age. It is a matter of respect and propriety though you are also concerned with the knowledge that the Inquisition continues to keep an eye not only upon the Blood Ravens but upon your allies as well. It infuriates you that Kyras’s taint has stretched beyond the bounds of the Chapter but there is little you can do but work past it as best you can.<br/>
<br/>
Now you must prepare for what forces will be assigned to those three upcoming missions though securing Aerus is likely to be unto a campaign itself. They will not easy though there is almost no such thing when it comes to matters of Astartes but the fact that Zerann would request this of your Blood Ravens implies that they may be even more grave than you might have initially thought. This self-thought prophecy is proven correct immediately upon your return to the ship for by then a hefty amount of data has been transmitted into the cogitators for your perusal.<br/>
<br/>
Forgeworld Aerus was lost during the Horus Heresy in a grand battle fought between the Mechanicus and its traitorous cousins in a stark and painful reminder of your own recent struggles. There were no others involved in that fighting as Aerus battled harshly against Zerann itself during the Heresy with both Forgeworlds having picked their own sides in that murky and bloody past. Without a single instance of Space Marine, or indeed Imperial Army or Navy involvement, the fight escalated to a truly incredible degree as the two technological powerhouses levied their full might against the enemy. It was a final and suicidal strike by Aerus’s Titan Legion upon Zerann itself which ended up destroying the cogitators containing the specific data of the location of Aerus though it <i>was</i> confirmed to have been defeated and savaged by orbital fire during the last moments of the Heresy.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is rediscovered, and none can be certain of what lies within. It will most certainly be treacherous, with feral machine intelligences, potential xenos threats, and of course – the potential for Chaos itself to try and take what they once corrupted. Whoever and whatever is sent there when the Mechanicus makes its move must be prepared for a harsh fight likely even for Space Marines and will have to be smart and capable of adapting to battle there even without good intel.<br/>
<br/>
Trontiux II on the other hand is far less concerning. The main issue there is the sheer size of the ork hordes which have begun assailing the Knight World from within their forests. While you hold great respect for the Imperial Knights wherever they may be the cold and unyielding calculus of the Mechanicus has determined that whatever the Knightly Houses say they simply cannot withstand the orks without outside support that the beleaguered Imperium around them cannot spare. Thus it falls to you do try and aid them. Such a sizable ork horde is no <i>easy</i> task of course, but it is not nearly the same in threat as to what Aerus may contain within itself. The forces you assign will have to be smart, but also tough to merely survive against the orkish aggression.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Final Zerann Decision:</u><br/>
[] Foreswear all claim to the Judgement of Carrion and allow the Mechanicus to move a fleet into Subsector Aurelia to take up a semi-permanent position while they explore the Space Hulk. Said fleet is an Explorator Fleet that is not yet fully stocked for truly long-term travel (Explorator long-term, that is). In doing so, this would allow repairs to begin on all of your ships at once but would also bring a foreign faction into what is effectively the Blood Ravens home Subsector given the state of the Chapter and its lack of major mobility.<br/>
[] Deny the Mechanicus this. The Judgement of Carrion must be destroyed once and for all, especially with an ork running around on the thing with the strength of will that Bludflagg possesses. It may offend the Mechanicus on some level but they know well the dangers of Space Hulks that cannot be properly dealt with. Not to mention you have seen and heard plenty of times for the Mechanicus to have too eagerly delved into technological archaeology only for it to turn out very badly for all those involved and all those nearby. You can begin bombardment immediately considering the ships you possess in Subsector Aurelia. With that, you may finally have removed one of the remaining greater threats within the Subesctor and give it time to heal properly.<br/>
