    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 11 (5pm)</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] Both must die.
- [*] Let the Sorcerer's attack play out, then finish off whoever survives.



Whatever information this emissary from the Council of Thirteen was to be taking back, it would almost certainly be to the detriment of Karak Eight Peaks. With the lightest touch you could manage, you gather the Ulgu of the room to you, the currents of the room altering almost unnoticeably so the energies edging away from the malign aura of the two Dhar-rich Skaven just happened to do so in your direction.

[Moments before the fight, Sorcerer vs Emissary: Intrigue, 26+???=??? vs 24+???-10(Unready)=???.]

The tone of the discussion changes, a swirl of Ulgu appearing in the Emissary's mind and just a hint of Shyish in the Sorcerer's as the questions start to become more barked, the answers more hurried, and the two Stormvermin begin to pay attention. Twin blunders, almost simultaneous: the Sorcerer has misstepped, but the Emissary thinks the misstep was a blunder in the game of information flowing from Eshin to the Council, not realizing it's instead a misstep in putting him off-guard before the Sorcerer strikes. You can see the Sorcerer weighing the decision for a moment, then without any visible change in his stance and without missing a syllable in his chattered replies, he begins to pull in energies from the air around him, much of it coming from the constant radiation from the Emissary's jewellery. Within the Sorcerer's soul, seven winds are crushed inside a grip of Ulgu until they run together as Dhar, and then the Sorcerer begins to shape the curdling payload as you watch with interest. A missile spell, obviously, not dissimilar to Shadow Knives or any other variation, except all the power comes from Dhar and all the control from Ulgu, resulting in something superior than what would be possible with either. The energies travel from soul to body, and then gather at the Skaven's chest, and a touch worked into a deferential half-bow transfers them to the Sorcerer's paw.

[Opening salvo: Intrigue, 29+20+20(Assassination)=69.]
[Emissary notices?: Intrigue, 29+15-10(Unready)=34.]
[Remaining Stormvermin notices?: Intrigue, 62+10+10(On Guard)=82.]

Without Magesight, the Sorcerer has the initiative. The first hint to mundane senses that anything is amiss is the soft sound of metal and flesh being parted as four summoned star-shaped projectiles bury themselves inside the left Stormvermin, and if your grasp of Skaven anatomy is correct, it looks like there's one in the heart, one in each lung, and one in the liver. The Emissary doesn't notice over the sound of his own voice, and in the faint green light of the Emissary's light-bauble, you see triumph flash across the Sorcerer's expression. But despite the act of being an unthinking, unmoving statue, the other Stormvermin was very much paying attention and a massive halberd swings through the air.

[Stormvermin vs Sorcerer: Martial, 26+20=46 vs 28+20=48.]
[Emissary reacts?: Martial, 33+10-10(Unready)=33.]
[Stormvermin vs Sorcerer 2: Martial, 6+20=26 vs 39+20=59.]

A crystal blade emerges from beneath the Sorcerer's cloak with amazing speed and just barely manages to halt the falling halberd, tiny crystalline shards pinging off the walls from a tiny shatter at the point of impact. You'd expect the Sorcerer to backpedal and it seems so would the Stormvermin, because he steps forward for a follow-up blow and steps into the Sorcerer skittering forwards, and the crystal blade slips through the Stormvermin's breastplate as if it presented no obstacle at all. Malign energies pulse and the blade snaps off where it meets flesh, and the Stormvermin shrieks as the shard within him fills with Dhar and then splinters, fragments burrowing through flesh and muscles and organs. The Sorcerer turns to the Emissary, who has only now begun to react, standing his ground and reaching inside his robes. With vicious triumph, the Sorcerer leaps forward, his half-length crystal blade raised high...

[Sorcerer vs Emissary: Martial, 79+20=99 vs 100+10+20(Pistolier)=130.]

And with an explosion of warpstone-laced gunpowder, the Sorcerer is arrested mid-flight and falls to the ground, smoke rising from a dozen holes shredded into his chest. With unhurried motions, the Emissary sheathes that pistol, draws a second, and unloads another cloud of warpstone fragments into the downed Sorcerer. The next item he draws is a quill, and he frowns down at the document and makes an entry at the bottom.

[Mathilde Interrupt: Intrigue, 31+22=53 vs 18+15-10(Unready for this, specifically)=23.]

Perhaps the illusion of the Sorcerer jerking back to his feet is missing some key detail, perhaps the Emissary has just that much faith in their pistols, perhaps they somehow notices your presence. With Branulhune already in mid-swing, they have barely a second to react, and if they had a second more things might have gone for you the same they went for the Sorcerer. But a glancing blow for any conventional weapon is more than enough purchase, and Branulhune punches through the metal vest under the Emissary's robes twice, once at either side. The Emissary comes apart at the middle, and having witnessed and almost experienced his reactions first-hand, you take no chances and remove his head with a second swing. Then you exhale, looking over the fallen. Perhaps fifteen seconds had passed since the Sorcerer made his move, and the echoes of the gunfire are still reverberating through the tunnels around you.

[Enough time to loot?: 47]

Somewhere in the distance, shouts and the scurry of claws. The documents are folded up and go into an internal pocket, the Sorcerer's cloak removed and wrapped around the crystal blade, which has begun to regrow to its full length. You draw one of the Emissary's pistols and give it a quick once-over; well-designed and intricate, but fundamentally the design was just a cut-down blunderbuss with warpstone powder and payload. You drop it and investigate a fizzing of energies on the Sorcerer, and find yourself holding half a shattered amulet, covered in interlinked runes; though you recognize none of them, they resemble Queekish. That's all the time you have before anyone arrives, and you disappear into the tunnels, leaving the Skaven to draw what conclusions they might from the fallen.

---

The document is mostly what you expected and some of what you feared. The recent events are creatively edited so that Mors are entirely to blame for Skryre's demise, and then Eshin are credited for Mors' destruction, including, worryingly, the slaying of Mors' Breeders. Perhaps it's merely them assuming a future victory and claiming the credit for it early, but perhaps they're already aware of your forces taking the Trenches. Interwoven in the Eshin aggrandizement are reports on the remaining powers in the Karak. The greenskins of Karag Rhyn, in enough detail that this could have been really useful if the Trolls hadn't moved in. The description of a 'Golem' in Mhonar, which is only half-correct but more than you knew until just hours ago. In a page all to itself, a description of the forces of the Red Fang tribe, including the Big Boss dedicated to the Underway push (Big Boss Gorfang the Hungry, especially skilled at making his underlings more afraid of him than they were of the enemy) and the Warboss himself, presumably currently leading the advance on the Western Gate (Warboss Birdmuncha the Really Zoggin' Big, who travels on an oversized Snotling pump wagon festooned with a variety of looted crossbows and firearms). Clan Eshin estimates the Waaagh at 400,000 Orcs and about twice that number of Snotlings, with, surprisingly, no Goblins seen anywhere.

And, finally, the Dwarven forces. They overestimate your siege weapons by a factor of three, underestimate your numbers by half, barely mention the Undumgi, and speculate the entire force is an Expedition from Karak Azul, and no mention is given to the link through Ulrikadrin to the rest of the Old World. And you're both relieved and annoyed that there's no mention of your own efforts. Is this the limits of what Eshin knows, focused as they've been on Clan Mors? Or are they keeping back information from the Council?

Matters for another time, as you process the reports that have come in while you were away. The northern portion of the Karag Yar cordon reports that the Dragon showed up, looked at them quite sternly until they lowered their weapons, then carefully stepped over their fortifications and meandered back towards Zilfin. There's also reports from Rangers ranging further and further into Yar; it seems there's fewer and fewer Skaven remaining, and all they've seen alive are Eshin as they withdraw upwards into the topmost sections of the Karag. Clan Mors seems to be either wiped out in Yar, or so close to it as to make no difference. The Karak Drazh pin remains, the sole remaining Mors force continuing to hold against the constant push of greenskins. Karag Rhyn is free of trolls, Karag Mhonar free of anything, and Kvinn-Wyr has gone quiet as the few Trolls that have a problem with their new neighbours have been slain.

[Word from the High King: 2.]

A pleasing set of reports, and under normal circumstances you'd be delighted with the state of affairs you were about to turn over to Belegar, as the Karagril flagpole has signalled 'King sighted'; a reasonable conclusion to make, as the gyrocopter that took word to Karaz-a-Karak has already returned, having pushed his engine near to destruction in his attempts to return to the Karak before night fell. But the document in your hands turns all that pride to ash, as you had quickly checked with Princess Edda to confirm you did have the rights you thought you did and then broken the seal of the High King as the acting ruler of Karak Eight Peaks. The Khazalid it contains is brusque, and centres on a single point: 25,000 Dwarves. 500,000 greenskins.

Die well, it closes, and bears the signature of High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer.

Die well.

You stare at the gyrocopter as it approaches. Today you've made contact with an Emperor Dragon and hunted down a Clan Eshin sorcerer, and you'd rather do both all over again than face the next few minutes, and have to watch what it will do to your King when he reads the message from his.


To be continued.
