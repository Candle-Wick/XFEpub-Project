The throne was rotting again. Freshly applied offal and chips of bone on intestinal string were turning to uselessness once more. Soon, soon, it would be time again. He knew it, even as he hated it, even as he loved it. The filthy grime on his blade's hilt was beginning to flake off, and would need many more freshly applied coats to enforce authority once more. Always more. Unblinking, he gazed out upon his macabre court, one eye seeing them for the shambling things they were, but the other…he found himself using the other more and more often these days. The green light which characterized all his kind had gradually filtered red, indicative of the continuing decay that all things suffered in this dismal place of dying suns. And with that eye, corrupted as it was, things were better to see. A finely dressed court of living necrontyr, overlords and phaerons, lords great and lesser, all conversing in their robes. Food, delicious things, and drink aplenty, all just out of reach. He had no mouth with which to slaver and no tongue to quest for each morsel, but in many ways, he felt that phantom muscle still.<br/>
<br/>
"My goodness, such a state of things."<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of flayed ones turned, whirling at the threat with claws extended, at the sound of the voice and the brief flash of light characteristic of matter teleportation. The charnel streets were flooded with them as they shambled from one place to the next, and they did not enjoy intruders. Unless, of course, they were made of flesh and bone, and thus were infinitely more desirable than anything else in existence. The human's eyes wept endlessly, but for all that his body attempted to shift one way or the next, the mindshackle scarab had been dug too deep. Slowly, but surely, they began to scrabble over one another, flesh and gobbets of meat both fresh and drying out squelching against one another as they did so. Yet, for a wonder, they all halted as the hyperphase sword rose up and slammed down, once and severed the arm of one who had come too close. Though the human tried to fight it, his face twisted itself along with his body into forcible nonchalance, head tilting and hand coming up to wrap around the chin. The wounded flayed one merely clutched after their lost limb, almost silent but for the barest whisper of its mad gibbering.<br/>
<br/>
"So it <i>is</i> true," the human's voice said with forced intrigue. "You can control them, or at least, hold some form of authority over them."<br/>
<br/>
Metallic fingers, each tipped with slowly growing claws, tightened around the hilt of the blade.<br/>
<br/>
"Ssspeak," Valgûl ground out, his slurring voice barely comprehensible through his emitters. "W-who <i>dares</i> come to the Bone Kkkingdom of D-razzak?"<br/>
<br/>
The human's eyes darted about for a moment before their whole body stiffened, his head bowing slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"I do apologize for the theatrics and precautions, but…well," the puppet gestured towards the milling flayed ones that were still growing in number about the throne's base, then back toward itself. "I…am one known by many titles, but the one I favor most is Trazyn the Infinite."<br/>
<br/>
The Overlord's constant twitches halted for a brief second. From one hollow-eyed blink of a scan to the next, Valgûl <i>saw</i> with his faltering gaze. In one, a human's body as nothing more than a puppet. But with the other eye, he saw the truth. A smirking necrontyr, chin cupped in delicate fingers, robes of gold and black billowing from some unseen wind. His skin and body were as radiation-scarred as any other of their kind, but he seemed incredibly hale than most had been towards the end of things. Sparkling jewelry hung low about his neck and upon his head, teeth almost shining in the dim light of the Ghoul Stars around them. He was ridiculously at ease, even with the royal guards of Drazak's court slowly marshalling themselves around him!<br/>
<br/>
"I...kkknow…you," Valgûl snarled, head twisting sideways much that it was nearly horizontal for a moment. "Y-you're name isss…<i>infamous</i>…e-even herrrre. W-why…doooo…you ap-aproach us?"<br/>
<br/>
Trazyn's smirk flickered, and slowly fell into a frown.<br/>
<br/>
"Because you, my good friend, are getting worse."<br/>
<br/>
"HHHHHOOOW D-DARE Y-Y-YOU!"<br/>
<br/>
Valgûl let loose a guttural roar as he stood, his hyperphase blade raised high and glowing ominously with power. Both eyes, one twisted and flickering and the other clear, brightened as well. The cloak of woven flesh he wore tore against the throne as he rose, ten thousand shards of bone that had stuck to the layers of offal on his body clinking as some fell away. Trazyn's puppet did not move other than a single step back as the overlord screamed obscenities. Voice crackling like a primitive's radio might in its transmissions, the Fallen Lord did not need to take a breath to continue, yet when he fell silent it was with all-too-organic huffs and gasps.<br/>
<br/>
"Y-you…d-daaaaare!" He finally said, having 'caught his breath'. "I…ammm m-master hhhhere. I! R-rule! H-heere!"<br/>
<br/>
The living metal that made up his body roiled. Tzrazyn's puppet simply pointed one trembling finger. Despite himself, Valgûl looked down, only to nearly drop his blade at the sight of his claws. Where once there had been a fine necron-designed and perfectly articulated hand, now lay an awkwardly gripping appendage which could barely hold the blade at all. Each digit had lengthened and sharpened, forcing an odd folding of them simply to hold onto his ancestral weapon. Valgûl's eyes flickered, granting him the dual vision which had become his constant companion. In one, he saw it as it should be. Thickly calloused necrontyr skin, honed over years of practice. But with the other, he saw it as it was. As he had not for too long.<br/>
<br/>
"Nnnn," a low groan escaped him, the words churning together in his mind to become a slurry. "N-no. Y-you did this…are…making…my me you no see b-body broken no no fault yours not me I!" He ended the nonsensical vomit of words in a shout.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh no, dear Valgûl, I didn't do this at all. Tell me, do you know how often you are ordering the 'Times of Bounty'?"<br/>
<br/>
The hundreds of flayed ones around them perked up at the words.<br/>
<br/>
"You haven't ordered a new one in months…because you haven't <i>stopped</i> ordering them. Daily. Hourly," Trazyn's voice continued to come from the human's throat. "Your chronometers are broken, my friend. Or they aren't, and you just can't…quite process them as you had before."<br/>
<br/>
Valgûl clutched at his head with his free hand, only to reel backwards at the sight of the extended claws there as well. What was happening to him? His body and armor were not fastidious and kept clean, the better to differentiate himself from his corrupted subjects, they were worse! Were it not for his blade, and his own knowledge of his identity, he would be nothing more than the most grotesque and devolved member of the flayed ones! Layers of fat and coagulated blood coated his entire body from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
"T-thisss…isss im-impossible," the overlord grated out. "I-I-I am…i-immune!"<br/>
<br/>
Trazyn's puppet tutted, the only thing taking away from it being the puppet's tears running down a grimy face.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that what you told yourself? No one is immune, Valgûl. Why do you think I sent this low-quality guardsman as my messenger rather than come personally?"<br/>
<br/>
"<i>NO!" </i>Valgûl howled, turning and swiping his blade through his throne, entire metallic body shaking. "I…I…"<br/>
<br/>
Then he whirled on Trazyn's servant, cloak of bloody skins wetly flapping through the air.<br/>
<br/>
"W-why-why-why-why did you c-come here, <i>Trazyn</i>," he hissed, voice breaking further, thoughts and words jumbling worse and worse as the edifice of his insanity began to collapse under its own weight.<br/>
<br/>
"To offer you something, dear Valgûl," Trazyn shrugged. "Most every necron could see it, could see how you were beginning to deteriorate more and more. Flayed ones across every awoken dynasty are beginning to flitter away to <i>you</i>, your numbers growing, all while your…<i>authority</i> over them was beginning to weaken. No one wants to see all of your…subjects…go wild. Who knows what would happen then? The Stormlord, the Mother of Oblivion, even the Silent King are watching you warily."<br/>
<br/>
The Fallen Lord's entire body continued to twitch, spikes of necrodermis slowly beginning to poke out through his body and pierce the layers of flesh he'd forgotten he'd wrapped himself in.<br/>
<br/>
"O-offer w-w-what?" Valgûl bit out, each word requiring effort to complete.<br/>
<br/>
"One. <i>Last</i>. Time of Bounty," Trazyn forced the human's body to smile, though it looked more like a rictus grimace. "One last harvest, something to do, to battle, while you are still <i>yourself</i>. Before you stop being a true Lord of the Necrontyr, and start being, well," he hooked a thumb towards the ever-increasing numbers of flayed ones. "Just another one of them."<br/>
<br/>
Even more were beginning to slink out of the shadows, some slipping noisily from a space between spaces and clattering to the ground before hauling themselves upwards.<br/>
<br/>
"Consider it," the human's hands were pushed to land atop Valgûl's shoulders, ignoring how necrodermis spikes began to slowly grow upwards through the palms and fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Or at least, the scarab kept the human from tearing them away, deadening the incessant signals of pain sent towards the brain.<br/>
<br/>
"Meat aplenty, for them. Worthy foes for you to test your blade upon. Is it not better to die as yourself, than lose what little we have left to remind ourselves of who we were, of who we are?"<br/>
<br/>
The mindshackle scarab twitched in its moorings, making the human do the same as rictus grin grew wider.<br/>
<br/>
"I know your name, Valgûl the Brave. Not 'The Fallen Lord'. You were once one of the greatest warriors in any dynasty across the galaxy, before <i>and</i> after the transfer. You can <i>still be</i>, one last time."<br/>
<br/>
Valgûl stared at the servant and pressed one hand into its stomach, the ends of his claws poking out of the back. The human let loose a pained wheeze, but that was all the scarab would allow, even as a few trickles of blood began to spill from cracked lips. He could not ignore the pleasure he got from it, nor the horror of feeling the pleasure spill out from him from one second to the next.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh dear. Is that your answer then? This one will <i>certainly</i> expire now."<br/>
<br/>
The necrodermis writhed and then came to an unsettling halt.<br/>
<br/>
"W-w-where…?"<br/>
<br/>
The human gurgled's Trazyn's words through their own blood.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you ever heard of what the humans call Cadia?"<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">================================================​</div><br/>
At first, the signs were dismissed. A patrol that ceased reporting in here. A small column of marching troops lost there. There were a thousand reasons that could have been at fault. Capricious daemons who decided that the needed some fun. Imperial assassins. Ork kommandoz, as absurd as their very existence was. A rival trying to gain an advantage was another possibility, for there was no shortage of those even on such battlefields as the 13th Black Crusade. But then the incursions grew worse. Slaves and traitor guardsmen were one thing. But when an astartes of the Black Legion was found torn to shreds, concerns were raised. But by then, it was already too late. The raised blasphemous fortress of the Chaos Lord Malefactus, once one of the Sons of Horus, then the Black Legion, was a bulwark against the Imperium's attempts to regain old territory on Cadia. The shields of their sorcerers had provided barriers against artillery bombardment, and the space marines within were more than enough to throw back every assault levied upon them.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, however, heralded by hundreds of black and green flashes of dimensional fracturing, their defenses were breached. Flayed ones in their thousands tore open the way into reality, leaping forward upon their fleshy foes. Corrupted flesh was still flesh, and the bone marrow inside of their posthuman corpses would still serve. But these were veterans of the Long War, and so reacted without panic or fracturing. Heavy bolters and lascannons tore into the shambling masses of their newest foes, others rushing forward with power swords and daemon blades alike. Possessed abominations still bearing cracked and bulged ceramite spat warp flame and tore at them with claws that could sear reality itself. But for every flayed one that fell, two more appeared out of the shadows behind them, the air in front of them, above and below them.<br/>
<br/>
"Filthy soulless xenos," Malefactus sneered as he clove three in twain with his massive blade. "You dare!? You dare try to fight the Black Legion in our hour of triumph!?"<br/>
<br/>
The daemon within was livid at the very existence of such things, screaming for its master to slay all before him. Such was fury that even the advanced technologies of the flayed ones could not revive them after being struck down. But more flayed ones arrived after that, simply appearing out nowhere. The sorcerous protections of the fortress faltered as, elsewhere, a sorcerous coven was slaughtered mid-spell. Malefactus staggered as he felt the backlash of the chained warp energies break apart in one, then another section of his fortress. His armor was scored heavily by the lunge of another maddened necron, but his flesh was not even touched before he could stab down through its chest and drive the blade up through its head.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was another flash of teleportation and it demanded every bit of strength and speed that Malefactus possessed to raise his weapon and block an incoming blow that nearly staggered him. A flayed one, one half of their face long ago ruined to leave nothing more than a flickering red orb, glared down at him. Layers of blood and flesh wrapped about its entire body. But the weapon in its hand pulsed with greenish yellow energies, and more importantly made his daemon sword scream as its very body was nearly cut apart. Unnatural warp energies warried with the arcane technologies of the xeno weapon in a crackling display of light that could blind an unaugmented human.<br/>
<br/>
"You…," Malefactus grinned through filed teeth, "You are their leader! Very well then! You face Maefactus! Favored of the Dark Gods!"<br/>
<br/>
The necron did not answer immediately, instead tearing their blade away from the lock and then unleashing a wild flurry of attacks that were each individually fatal if they had landed properly. The chaos space marine responded in kind, ending with an overhead slam that sent his opponent leaping backwards. It held itself badly, knees bent at different angles, head tilted near horizontal, free arm's claws clenching open and closed repeatedly. There was nothing of the nobility left in it that it had once claimed for itself.<br/>
<br/>
"G-g-giveee….me…y-your…FLESSSH!" Valgûl screamed.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">==========================================​</div><br/>
Across more than three sectors burning under the fires of the 13th Black Crusade, the flayed ones came. Attracted first by the Fallen Lord's authority and ability to bring them bounty. Then by the sheer concentration of their fellow corrupted brethren. From dynasty to dynasty, they began to flit away from battlefields that necrons fought upon. Only the Maynarkh, the first infected with the virus, retained their mindless brethren with the unyielding control of the Mother of Oblivion. She would not let them go when there remained life to exterminate within Segmentum Tempestus. But for those who did come, there was grand harvest of flesh and bone waiting. Even with weakening minds, the fleets of Drazak still managed their own harvests before finally devolving to a point of uselessness. Gauss artillery, lightning arrays, and worse blew apart a dozen Chaos warships before they were even aware of the threat. Necron vessels hounded flotillas of enemy ships, eagerly teleporting the flesh and organic fragments left behind into their holds to be utilized. On the planets below, the flayed ones fell upon every morsel they could find. None could say how many necrons had become truly infected by the C'tan Llandu'gor's curse since the star god had been destroyed. Many of them simply disappeared into wherever it is their kind left to when not hunting, hidden charnel palaces and abbatoir courts lost to all but those infected.<br/>
<br/>
But by the reckoning of the crypteks observing the endless conflagration, there was only one resounding conclusion communicated to the phaerons and overlords; far too many.<br/>
<br/>
A Chaos Lord of Khorne, mid-ascension, was rent apart by gauss weaponry. A dozen monoliths appeared from nowhere, teleporting onto Cadia itself, and wiped-out hundreds of ork tanks and battlewagons. On the worlds of the Agripinna Sector, the WAAAGH!!! Wazdakka faltered as their precious vehicles were assaulted by maddened necron immortals and destroyers. Their ships were blown to pieces by marauding harvesting vessels eager for the bounty of flesh offered to them. More were shredded by flayed ones seeking to drape themselves in ever more cloaks of flesh and meat. Leadership was lost to them, especially after the rider of the Bike of the Aporkalypse was last seen riding at hundreds of miles an hour directly into an Imperial bastion, only for a solid half-kilometer of ground to disappear from the local space time continuum with nothing less than the sound of amused humming to be heard in the aftermath. Screeching Tzeentchian Warbands unleashed daemonic fire at beings that were already too mad to be properly manipulated. Waves of flayed ones walked through the poisonous bogs and acidic mists that the followers of Nurgle had surrounded their bastions in the Cadian Gate with, metallic bodies not rusting away fast enough to save their prey.<br/>
<br/>
The Daemon Primarch, Perturabo, grew ever more bitter and furious as his precisely crafted strategems and organization over the void were upended by the greenskins. They had even wounded his body in the <i>Iron Blood</i>, simply by their passage. Yet now, his fury grew all the greater, an ambient aura of Warp energies manifesting around his ship-body that caused any who glanced at it with unguarded eyes and soul to sprout horrid things from their eye sockets. For just as he had finally reorganized the ships, refitted and recalculated his plans, the necrons had appeared. Just as he had begun to advance once more across the atmosphere of Cadia itself, a fleet led by a trio of Cairn-class Tomb Ships had shifted into reality just in front of them, blocking off a group of Imperial ships that had bravely been preparing to sell their lives to hold off the Glorianas. The Imperials, wisely and confusedly, retreated while burning fuel stores and redlining their engines to do so. Perturabo, who had never faced the Necrons in true combat before, was less willing.<br/>
<br/>
A week later, with the <i>Iron Blood</i> suffering from literal hundreds of punctures throughout its superstructure, the <i>Nightfall</i> shattered into five pieces that broke apart further in a meteor shower over the western atmosphere of Cadia, the destruction of a hundred cruisers, ten battleships, thirty four battlecruisers, eighteen grand cruisers, ten Ark Mechanicus' of the Dark Mechanicus, a thousand escort ships, well over five million crewmen, slaves, and void armsmen, the loss of a third of the bare handful of true Iron Warriors from the Horus Heresy, three thousand more Chaos Space Marines from various other origins, and the Imperium surging forward with guns blazing, the seething Daemon Primarch finally signaled the retreat. A retreat that coast another thousand Chaos Space Marines and another pair of Dark Mechanicus fleets that wished to contest the alien technologies of the xenos. For while there remained a vast bounty of destroyed Necron ships, enough to make devotees of the Omnissiah regardless of one's interpretation of that God, slaver with no longer existing organic throats, whetting long ago replaced tongues, it could not be touched. The Imperium had taken advantage of the distraction, and their newest push over Cadia was led by the Phalanx itself, taking a daring move away from its previous static position. The relatively fresh forces of the Imperial Navy were too much for the Daemon Primarch, at the moment at least, which only enraged him all the further despite the technical victory won by the servants of the Dark Gods. <br/>
<br/>
It was a retreat across much of the Cadian System, in fact, as the Necrons focused their efforts primarily on the servants of the Chaos Gods. Though the majority of the Necrons had left their loyalties to the Star Gods behind, the Flayer's Curse was a strong one, and no matter what the Lord of the Bone Kingdom had ever wished to believe, Llandu'gor's wrath bled through. Both for those slaves who had slain it and the Chaos Gods as well.<br/>
<br/>
For a time, things were well. A reprieve had been found for the forces of the Imperium, allowing them to retake many positions and fortify those they already held. Entire worlds were reclaimed, forces were redistributed, and though few below the highest echelons of command knew it, some of the Pylons of Cadia found themselves repaired by a wayward curator and an ancient near-Heretek Magos. Across the Cadian Gate and in some cases beyond, the forces of Chaos recoiled as they attempted to deal with the incessant swarms of flayed ones appearing behind their lines and massacring those they could reach before being blown to pieces. In the void, Imperial vessels were able to resupply themselves as well as bring direly needed support to their forces upon the ground. Transports carrying reinforcements were able to make it through for once and deliver fresh troops and munitions to twenty different planets. The New Men made a greater fight than many of their base human cultist brethren, but they too died. The servants of Mars were even able to pick apart and take much samples of alien technology to study from the many shattered Necron ships that even then still tumbled slowly about in the skies above Cadia. <br/>
<br/>
Abbatoirs were unleashed, harvesting not for the C'tan as they had in the past, but instead simply to kill, life forces expunged in manners such that not even a scrap was delivered unto the Warp for the Dark Gods to feast upon. Something all the more infuriating to them as entire swarms of daemons were taken, then cleansed into a true death beyond any possible retrieval. Before the few devices that the Fallen Lord had possessed were fully destroyed, they contributed to the loss of both a Changer of Ways and a Bloodthirster, much to the dismay of the cultists who had sacrificed so much to summon them. A Megalith dropped almost directly onto the Great Despot of Dreguk's head and wreaked much havoc upon the greenskins before the Warlord's Mega-Gargants could blow it to pieces. The single Aeonic Orb that the Bone Kingdom held was unleashed as well, and for the single hour before desperate devotees of Chaos brought it down, nine Black Cathedrals that the Word Bearers had erected on Cadia's surface over the decades were reduced to atomized nothingness, leaving naught but stark bedrock behind. Its destruction further wiped out over a hundred of the most mindlessly bloodthirsty of the World Eaters in the act of destroying it.<br/>
<br/>
But it could not have lasted.<br/>
<br/>
Trazyn watched it happen, knowing he would have to be satisfied with a recording and perfect image capture rather than the body itself. Even he would not dare bring a flayed one, even one such as Valgûl, into his precious galleries. What if the virus spread to the rest of the gallery, or even to his own personage? Absurd, who would take care of the archives then if he was off shambling about moaning about blood and bone? So instead he watched, recording as the last battle of the Fallen Lord concluded. In the end, after all the chaos that he had caused, the Warmaster of Chaos elected for a personal touch to put the insane necron down, taking with him not just the Aphotic Blade, but members of the Iron Warriors, World Eaters, and Death Guard as well who had sworn vengeance for the death dealt unto them by the necrons. Elder champions of Chaos, veterans of the Siege of Terra itself, and still Valgûl slew a number before his body lay broken before them.<br/>
<br/>
There would be no return to Drazak for him, or any of his subjects, however. The recall systems would never function again.<br/>
<br/>
Trazyn had seen to that.<br/>
<br/>
Still he was disappointed, if not entirely surprised, to see the flayed ones go berserk with the loss of their master. Soon, Imperial supply depots found themselves also under assault. A space marine spearhead, an entire company of some 'chapter' or another – charming little designators they came up for themselves – was slaughtered before reaching their target. Multiple Orkish war camps found battle against a new foe, one which the so-called 'Beast of Armageddon' himself seemed to enjoy smashing. Across a great many worlds, some held by the Imperium, some lost, the Flayed Ones continued to arrive. There was a feast to be had, the grandest in many ages, and so they continued to come. Mad alien vessels danced back and forth across the void without rhyme or reason, destruction for all heralded in their wake as they unleashed the deadly technologies of their kind. Absolute anarchy continued to erupt across just as many Chaos positions as Imperial or orkish ones. The forces of Chaos raged. The forces of the greenskins were exultant. The forces of the Imperium straightened their back, narrowed their eyes, and prepared to do what they could after a bare handful of months of quasi-reprieve as the year finally reached its end.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the situation had altered its axis once more, rather than fully progressing in what one might call favorable for any side save for the orks for the fighting and the Flayed Ones for the bounty of meat.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh well. It was interesting at least. And such an image for my galleries!"<br/>
<br/>
And the 13th Black Crusade ground on.</div>
