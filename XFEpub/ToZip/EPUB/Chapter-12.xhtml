    <h2>Past and Present: Eldar</h2>
<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>+0.621.997.M41+<br/>
The Past and Present: Eldar</b><br/>​</div>He had walked many worlds in his time, but few had been so wracked with pain as this one. Slain twice over, yet the ghosts still wailed in near silence, prickling at his senses. It may have been a world of the savages and butchers but it had been a world full of life. Once. No longer. With the passing of the cursed Blood Ravens back to the stars, he alone walked on the world that had once challenged the capital of the Mon-Keigh Sector. Being the only thing alive on such a planet gave him a feeling full of foreboding and muted horror. So much destruction here, and for what. For bright and yet short flashes of light to burst into being and die again, all the while his people ground themselves to bloody dust. The quiet howling wind which blew forlornly matched his mood most appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
Still, his long life of experience and time in this Path had seemingly ingrained certain instincts permanently into his body. Despite the total lack of life on the world of Cyrene besides himself, his leapt and crept his way through the rubble of an entire dead world in complete and total silence. His stealth field remained active and thrumming in the quiet, his eyes searching for even the slightest hint of movement that did not come from him. Pointless, of course, like all things, but he had a sworn duty as an elder brother, one that had perhaps he not shirked it at that crucial time would have resulted in a living sister. A family that had not been reduced to one. Yet that was the time he lived in. Where faint and unclear visions would be happily followed right into the abyss, again and again and <i>again. </i><br/>
<br/>
Something crunched beneath his feet, metal this time and not lifeless gravel, and so he paused to gaze down. Kneeling, he carefully wiped away the dust and dirt to reveal something that would have made his blood boil had he the energy and care for it. A <i>Space Marine </i>helmet. More than that, a <i>Blood Raven</i> helmet. How much damage had this one group of Mon-Keigh dealt to his people personally? Kronus. Kaurava. Here. No one Chapter should have bested an Avatar of Khaine so many times. Much less...much less <i>that</i> one, who he could only hope had been killed in the fighting at some point. It was one of the few things that kept him going, the lack of seeing the same Force Commander who had faced an Avatar of Khaine in single combat while the rest of his forces had fought off the rest of the Warhost. To his shame - and oh why not he had quite the list at this point - when the Avatar had been felled he'd fallen back, abandoning the shot which might have pierced the head of the monstrous Mon-Keigh who had slain it.<br/>
<br/>
It was white in color with green leaflets painted along the sides, if quite dented and damaged from somehow surviving the continual orbital bombardment over the area to 'cleanse it' after the death of the Daemon Prince Kyras. Snarling, he tossed the blasted thing aside. At the least, it was likely that he was getting closer. It was a foolish hope, he knew, after the Eldar had left this supposedly doomed Subsector to its fate, after the oh-so-superior Kayleth had lost her head to that Ork Freebooter and with her one of the vaunted Farseers of Ulthwé and Warlocks of Biel-tan. It just went to show what happened when the Eldar grew too reliant on their abilities to see the future. They died because they were looking too far ahead instead of on what was right in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
A crackle of dirt! He whipped upwards and sprang into the shadows, rifle coming out and hand dropping for his pistol as he gazed through the scopes. Perhaps he had been wrong when he thought himself the only living thing here. Another scavenger? Mon-Keigh come to pick over the carcass of their twice-killed prey? Orks? Eyes narrowed from behind his mask as it scanned out across the spectrum and found nothing. Radiation was useless given what had been done to this world, yet it had cooled remarkably after its second death. Even so, there were no heat signatures save for his faint own, and the wind most certainly did not blow here. His heart thumped wildly in his chest, even as he attempted to calm it. Some of his people might be so arrogant as to believe themselves inviolable against the lesser races, but he had seen too many Eldar lives claimed by too many of said 'lesser' races. Whether it was a blade of their darker brethren, the whirring weapons of the Mon-Keigh, or the primitive weapons of orks, Eldar died all the same. Alone and equipped as he was, he would be no match for a Blood Raven squad, and he knew it.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully, after a few more tense moments which had been joined by two more crunches of rock, he found the source. An arching spire of calcified and scorched rock which had clearly been forced into its shape by the forces that had once been unleashed upon the world. Without them, it's unsustainable geometry began to succumb to one of the few forces on the planet remaining - gravity. Rolling his eyes and putting his weapons away once more he continued towards his destination.<br/>
<br/>
There was no one but him to hear himself snort, even as he found evidence of more battle. A ruined vehicle of some kind, its shell still vaguely recognizable despite the metal being bent and warped into one solid mass by the sheer heat unleashed by the bombardment weapons. More rubble. More broken bits and pieces of <i>Blood Raven</i> equipment. It did not feel him with as much satisfaction as he had hoped it would, though it did put a slight bit more faith into his heart that perhaps...perhaps everything was not lost. If the pathetic cobbling of the Mon-Keigh had survived, perhaps...perhaps...<br/>
<br/>
He came to the lip of the final downward dip into the crater below and stared. Here, the land had been changed forever as the orbital weapons had fired again and again. Whole craters and paths had been created by the blackened and tortured earth, whatever unnatural Chaos-related life that had put it to glowing with disgusting daemonic life gone now by fury and primitive weaponry. His thoughts shuddered to a despairing halt, for here there was <i>no</i> sign of the fierce fight that had been here. Here had the bombardment been fiercest, and so here there was not even broken panels of metal or a single 'tooth' from a human chain-weapon. Grief threatened to engulf him once more, but he persevered and headed down. The echoes of the battle whispered tantalizingly at the very edges of his hearing, resounding even now. The boom of a plasma gun, the shouting of primitive prayer and clanging of metals both natural and warp-tainted. A thunderous and <i>evil</i> laugh turned towards shriek of surprise, dismay, fury.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually he came to it, that final place, where the creature Kyras had fallen. Almost, no, most certainly with desperation he focused the incredible technologies of his people into searching. Something. <i>Anything</i>. His helmet's sensors were some of the most advanced technologies capable of being produced by the Eldar and still he found nothing. He strode back and forth, feet scraping away dust to find the blackened rock beneath, even kneeling in some places to lift up smaller rocks.<br/>
<br/>
"Please. <i>Please. </i>Khaine, Vaul, Asuryan, <i>any of you</i> please..." he began to mutter to himself, searching relentlessly. Even as he did so he knew it was too late. Foolish. Impossible. Nothing had survived. Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, he found himself standing in the direct center of that crater, before the strength of his legs failed and he fell to his knees. Tears fell within his helmet, and finally, faced with the truth, he could do nothing but shatter. Pain, immense in its sheer scope, enveloped him, and he let it. All the self control drifted back until his lips split open like some feral animal to let him scream to the uncaring heavens. Even now, his younger sister's soul was being devoured by Slaanesh. Even now, it was being consumed like so many others. Because he had <i>failed</i>, just like the rest of the Eldar had <i>failed</i>, like everything <i>failed. </i>He knew not how long he remained there. In point of fact some part of him considered remaining there for the rest of his hopefully short life.<br/>
<br/>
There was the click of a gun's safety being removed and the pressing of a gun barrel against the back of his head.<br/>
<br/>
"I'd wondered why you were coming here, but that just confirms it," a rasping voice said behind him. A <i>Mon-Keigh</i> voice. But that had to be impossible, no human could possibly manage this, not even one of the hated Blood Ravens.<br/>
<br/>
But he could not bring himself to care. Ronahn of Ulthwé had stopped caring the moment he realized that he was finally and so painfully alone. Idly he realized that here was the obvious reason that he had been caught unawares like this. So consumed by his grief, he had not noticed it, and before he had been too focused on coming to this damned place to be on full alert. That was how the primitive had managed it. Or maybe not, but what did he care? Taldeer was gone, her soul a feast for She Who Thirsts.<br/>
<br/>
"If you are going to kill me, human, then do it. You could not match the pain I already feel if you tried though I suppose if you wished to take your time I could not stop you."<br/>
<br/>
A lie. He probably could. But it didn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
"I could. It would be as the Codex would command. As all normal doctrine would suggest," the human rasped as he dug the gun slightly further into the back of Ronahn's head. Said barrel, based on what the ranger could feel, was most certainly a Space Marine sized weapon. "But first, I would check that my suspicions are correct."<br/>
<br/>
Then the human did the impossible, and from behind his shoulder Ronahn's eyes nearly bulged out of his sockets as they tracked a glowing - undamaged how is it undamaged - spirit stone flip onto the ground just out of his reach. He scrabbled towards it only for the Space Marine, and it had to be based on the weight and self-assured manner it dealt with him, to push him down onto his front.<br/>
<br/>
"T-Taldeer!" he grunted, eyes locked onto the spirit stone.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, thought so," the rasping voice said with a note of satisfaction before the weight left Ronahn's back. In an instant he had pushed himself forward, and the moment he touched it...<br/>
<br/>
<i>....Ronahn?</i><br/>
<br/>
Tears came down once more, and this time they were joyous, even as he cautiously turned about to face the strange human who held a primitive yet extremely deadly looking shotgun in its hands. His eyes drank in the sight of the one who had returned his sister to him, the long hair and single bionic eye not making an impact so much as the much slighter frame of the human. The larger gear associated with his kind was not present, but Ronahn's eyes narrowed as he sighted the sigil of the <i>Blood Ravens</i> emblazoned on the one shoulder he could see. The other was covered by a ragged cloak which also concealed much of the human's body.<br/>
<br/>
"Why?" he said, free hand drifting towards his pistol.<br/>
<br/>
"The Coven of Isha is still remembered by the Deathwatch and the Ordo Xenos, even if most don't like to think about it," was the response, to the rangers great confusion.<br/>
<br/>
"What? I don't-,"<br/>
<br/>
"It doesn't matter what you know or don't know. What matters is this. Your Craftworld stays <i>out</i> of Aurelia from here on in. I've tracked you once, and I can do it again. Next time I won't be nearly as forgiving."<br/>
<br/>
At that, Ronahn's eyes narrowed.<br/>
<br/>
"I've been tracking you since you landed your ship here. Don't. Test me."<br/>
<br/>
They stood in that crater for a solid minute, staring at each other silently. Slowly Ronahn allowed himself to take in the full measure of the human before him. And, after that period of time, he found himself startled as his mind - emotion and pride stripped by centuries of practice - came up uncertain on whether or not he could actually win if it came to a fight. More than that, he felt the prodding of his sister's weary and muffled mind, and that more than anything made him relax his stance.<br/>
<br/>
"I will leave, then."<br/>
<br/>
"If any knew I was doing this, I would be slain on the spot. Had it <i>been</i> any other Blood Raven, your fate would have been sealed the moment you touched down. For your sake, be thankful that the Chapter Master gave me full reign to do as I wished regarding all of this."<br/>
<br/>
The ranger slowly began to back away, accepting this in his single driving focus to return Taldeer to her Craftworld, but he kept his eyes on the human at all times. Yet, just before he drifted out of sight, he spoke one last time.<br/>
<br/>
"What is your name, human?"<br/>
<br/>
"My name is not important, Ronahn of Ulthwé," came the response, shocking Ronahn down to his core. "Now leave."<br/>
<br/>
And so he ran, ran as fast as he could towards his ship, just in case the endless capacity of humans for treachery came to the fore once again.<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>​</div>Cyrus watched the Eldar run the entire time, and flicked his thumb against the detonator the entire time as it flew away. The explosives had quite the effective range, and he knew that if he wanted to he could have blown both the ranger and his precious spirit stone away in one single motion. But he didn't, though the reasons were not ones that he particularly liked. At the same time, his long years in the Death Watch had long ago deadened his tongue against bitter tastes like this, and so he merely flicked his thumb against the detonator endlessly until it was out of range. Once it had done so, a hand went to his ear, and the communication channel crackled open.<br/>
<br/>
"Is it done, Cyrus?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Chapter Master."<br/>
<br/>
"...."<br/>
<br/>
"Speak, Cyrus."<br/>
<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
<br/>
"So that all debts are repaid. Now they have been, and honor satisfied. From here on out, should they dare to once again face us, we shall persecute them with absolute prejudice."<br/>
<br/>
No one else was alive on Cyrene to see Cyrus smile, but he did it all the same.<br/>
<br/>
"<i>Good</i>."</div>
