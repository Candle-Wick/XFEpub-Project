It was always a ruinous sight to view one so twisted by Chaos. The foe’s body was swollen by the power that had infused them, their armor crafted of blasphemy and tainted by the corruption it had stewed in for so long. There was not a single iota of purity amongst the assembly, rather the opposite. An enormous power glaive crackled with white lightning, the symbols of the Dark Gods daubed upon it in blood so many times the stains had turned black. Grasped, in turn, by a spiked power armored fist upon which fresh gore had been spilt. Spikes upon the pauldrons were impaled with the heads of foes worthy enough of becoming emblematic of the inevitable victory of Chaos. A rival here. A glorious Imperial Captain there. Several heads still bore their helms, the space marines that once bore them now dead. Standing upon a pile of bodies, it was the horrific archetypical scene repeated so many times in the galaxy since the Horus Heresy and even before. A champion of darkness, haloed from behind from the lights of the ruination that they had caused. A juggernaut, glowering out at the foe which would inevitably rise against them, enflamed with hatred and ready to fight forever, and ever.<br/>
<br/>
But then, there were the differences.<br/>
<br/>
The power glaive’s field chittered and broke repeatedly, sparking wildly as it struggled and failed to compensate for the damage it had received. The blade itself was chipped and broken in many places, jagged beyond artistry into open failure. Even through the power armor, the grip on the weapon trembled and struggled to hold on, droplets of blood trickling through the cracks to drop onto the dusty ground. They had fallen to a knee, the other leg shattered and unable to hold them up any longer. There were rents and tears, buckled plates and torn bundles of cabling, while the power pack itself grew dimmer and dimmer. None of this, of course, proved as much of an issue as the massive hole torn into the belly, scored through entirely from front and out of the back. The flesh within was hyper-cauterized, only a few inches of plate holding meat in place preventing them from having been bisected entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the bodies that he stood upon were not, in fact, those of loyalists. They were of his own forces.<br/>
<br/>
“Loyal…<i>dogs</i>,” the Anarch rasped, struggling to remain upright with the glaive’s haft jabbed into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
“So he speaks,” his slayer spoke, the steam still rising from their multi-melta. “You were all silent before now. By Vulkan, the rest of them still are,” they gestured with their weapon towards where the last three companies of the Sons of Malice were still fighting against the bellowing Black Templars. “Even as you fight and die, you are silent.”<br/>
<br/>
Aramus twisted his hammer in his grip, cleansing it somewhat of the tainted blood that had been smeared across it.<br/>
<br/>
“It is their way, N’mul,” the Savior of Aurelia shrugged. “Let us be done with him.”<br/>
<br/>
Even with most of his respiratory organs gone, Kathal sucked in another ragged bloody breath.<br/>
<br/>
“You think your service here will save you?” The traitor shook their head slowly. “No. The rotting Imperium will turn on you, eventually. <i>Always</i>. And on the day that that happens, Malice Himself will welcome you into his grasp, like so many others.”<br/>
<br/>
N’mul tilted his head and shrugged as best as one could within terminator armor – which was not much at all – and fired again. So died Kathal, Anarch of the Sons of Malice, former Captain of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company of a chapter whose name had been lost to time. His upper torso burnt into nothingness by a sustained blast from N’mul of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Grand Company. Aramus said nothing as his friend continued to fire until there was nothing but black soot stains to mark the passage of a literal thousand-year old foe of the Imperium. The effect was not instantaneous. The Sons of Malice had given no sign of their distress even as they’d been pushed back across the surface of Scelus, their massive slave armies challenged by the might of several freshly resupplied Imperial Guard regiments. Even with the vast majority of their force cutting off Kathal and his corrupted facsimile of honor guard from the rest of his own, they had not immediately turned about to try and rescue him.<br/>
<br/>
“We are done here then, Commander.”<br/>
<br/>
Neither Aramus nor N’mul’s squad looked over at the hellish screaming vortex with limbs that was the strange daemonic entity that had been summoned forth by the former loyalist chapter. The Grey Knights bellowed their chants and fought it directly, the only ones on the entire battlefield able to do so. They had other things to fight, as larger and larger amounts of the enemy force began to turn and try to flee. There was nowhere to go, of course, the Imperial Navy had seen to that, but cowardice was its own strange entity. Their part in this was done, to participate further was to only risk destruction that was no longer required.<br/>
<br/>
Aramus nodded, his vox opening up in the same motion.<br/>
<br/>
“Sarrelen, we are done. Is the teleportarium ready to bring us back up?”<br/>
<br/>
There was a moment of tense static as the strike force stood in the burning remains of the command center. They were mighty, but this was not a prepared area for defense. If the slave armies turned on them as they began to ran, repulsed as they were by the Black Templars and Imperial Guard, they might even manage to overwhelm them. The Sons of Malice had seemingly accepted their impending deaths along with their ships, preferring to fight utterly to the last rather than flee yet again from their old homeworld. But then the crackling resolved into the calm tones of the techmarine.<br/>
<br/>
“Teleportarium ready, Commander. Gird yourselves for retrieval.”<br/>
<br/>
All those present began to mutter canticles of purity and safety before there was the sharp tang of sour ozone in their throats and the warp all around them. It lasted for but a second, yet every usage of teleportation this close to the Eye of Terror carried even greater dangers than on average. Then they were back aboard the <i>Retribution</i>. A quiet series of cheers went up from the hard-bitten serfs of the strike cruiser as their masters returned safely by most measures of the word. There was significant damage, of course. A good number of the Salamanders would require healing afterwards, but none had died. That was a victory in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
“A good day, a good victory,” N’mul proclaimed, a stamping of armored feet from his squad being the rousing agreement.<br/>
<br/>
“It certainly was a victory,” Aramus allowed, the ghost of a smile on his lips. “But Scelus is still a barren world. The Sons of Malice were willing to throw themselves to their deaths to reclaim it, and now they are dead. But while we were here, the Imperium forced to dedicate so many to repulse their personal crusade, the scales tip wildly elsewhere.”<br/>
<br/>
N’mul shook his head, his red eyes gleaming in the bright lights of the teleportarium, his own smile dimming as he glanced at the weary Force Commander.<br/>
<br/>
“Aramus…this <i>was</i> a victory,” he pushed, turning slightly to allow his squad to return to quarters for armor repairs and healing. “If that doesn’t hearten you, I don’t much know what else would.”<br/>
<br/>
Aramus simply sighed and continued walking, the two of them thumping to where the serfs prepared to release them from their armors. There was no answer from him until both were completely extricated and their skins bare to the world save for some light shifts and robes. By now, the sight of the faint shine of the bionics in Aramus’ chest and shoulders was a familiar sight.<br/>
<br/>
“I know that, N’mul. But I have been doing this for longer than the Gothic War lasted from start to finish, and yet it never seems to make any dent. If it was the Sons of Malice today, it was the World Eaters yesterday, and the Black Legion tomorrow.”<br/>
<br/>
There was a bone-deep weariness which had cloaked the Force Commander, and though N’mul had known it for some time it was another thing to view it so encompassing, so strongly.<br/>
<br/>
“Aramus…,”<br/>
<br/>
A scarred hand rose up to interrupt him.<br/>
<br/>
“I have heard the cry of the Salamanders well,” his friend interrupted, “Into the fires of battle, unto the anvil of war. But N’mul…,” Aramus looked at him, his gaze nearly hollowed. “I have been chained to this anvil for many, many years. I fear it is breaking me. And, worse, I am starting to think that that is a good thing.”<br/>
<br/>
Large hands clasped around the Blood Raven’s shoulders, shaking him slightly and making him look directly into the Salamander’s own. There, Aramus thought silently, there is the strength of a marine who knows his primarch. Whose very appearance so matches the one they came from. Be they sons of Corax, Vulkan, Dorn, the Lion, or Guilliman, all could be said to share features and personalities. In times like this, the words of Avitus came back to haunt him from the whispers in his nightmares. Who, indeed, had ever heard of a chapter who did not know their primarch? Only one who had something to hide. His own efforts, sneering, so prideful, so sure of his victory regardless of the circumstances. The dead Blood Ravens, the shattered ghosts of the past, haunted him still for his near fall. The betrayals, the heresies, the whispered secrets…Aramus did not know who the primarch of the Blood Ravens was.<br/>
<br/>
But he had grown ever more certain, in these times, of who their primarch <i>was not</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Was that what had driven so many Blood Ravens into madness? The truth he now kept to himself?<br/>
<br/>
“- and you have done <i>much</i> for so many. You saved Mordax Prime! The tales of the Bloody Hill are legend already! You have fought across the Scarus Sector, saved my life, and were essential to the defense of Amistel Majoris! You are being <i>tempered</i>, my friend, <i>not</i> broken. Believe me.”<br/>
<br/>
Aramus blinked, and realized he’d missed the entire first quarter of N’mul’s impassioned speech to him.<br/>
<br/>
“N’mul, why do you still follow me?”<br/>
<br/>
Coal-black skin twisted slightly as the Salamander raised an eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
“Eh?”<br/>
<br/>
“The 7<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company of the Salamanders is without a Captain, but they have sent us more of your brothers. They follow your orders. You’ve the making of a restored company here and now, but you do not return to Nocturne to receive your promotion,” he raised a hand to forestall the familiar protest, “We both know that as the senior-most remaining member of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company, it would fall to you. But instead, you keep me as Force Commander, follow my orders, remain upon my strike cruiser when a whole fleet might be yours.”<br/>
<br/>
Aramus seemed almost unwholesomely enlivened by his indignation.<br/>
<br/>
“So why are you still here?”<br/>
<br/>
N’mul just shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
“Because. We are still doing good here. I will not abandon the people of these sectors to their deaths simply so that I can go back to Nocturne for the Ritual of Ascension and then fight the currents of the warp just to come back.”<br/>
<br/>
His red eyes narrowed.<br/>
<br/>
“I <i>will not</i>. And if that means remaining with you, and retaining my rank as sergeant? Then let it be so.”<br/>
<br/>
Aramus was silent.<br/>
<br/>
“And the rest of the Salamanders? They are…amenable with this situation?”<br/>
<br/>
N’mul shrugged and turned about, beginning to walk back down the corridor.<br/>
<br/>
“They have sent us new brothers, and they report to me. I suppose that there is a chance another is named Captain, who might yet order my return. But they have not done it yet. And in the meantime, we have battlefields to attend to. I assume that the Forgefather is busy with the rest of the Chapter's efforts on Armageddon. The 7th Company's ships were destroyed in the fighting anyhow, from the ruin you rescued me from. They don't have any more to send at the moment, I think.”<br/>
<br/>
They spoke no more until they returned to the tactical room. The holographic representations danced and flickered as they ever did. The closer they got to the center of the Eye, the worse it got, despite there being no reason to. A thousand crisis markers demanded attention, and all knew they would never have enough. Sarrelen greeted them with a nod, already fiddling with the console.<br/>
<br/>
“Commander. Sergeant. Here to pick our next target?”<br/>
<br/>
One icon in particular caught Aramus’ attention.<br/>
<br/>
“There, in the Agripinaa Sector. The Albitern System. They’re getting reports of dark eldar raids, World Eaters, and numerous cultist armies. There aren’t enough Imperial forces nearby who can respond in time. But we can make it, and help keep people alive until they can.”<br/>
<br/>
In the past, it would be an enemy champion. A mighty, decapitating strike, something worthy of glory. But the taste of such things had long become ash in his mouth. Now it was all he could do to save what little he could. Even then that would never be enough.<br/>
<br/>
"Very well, Commander. We shall move out immediately."<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, the engines of the <i>Retribution</i> activated and it slid back into the warp, already seeking its next target. There was penance to be done. Perhaps, even, forever.</div>
