    <h2>The March to Karak Eight Peaks - Week 6 - The Banks of the Blood River</h2>


Spoiler: Winning Vote



[*] Ulthar's Rangers and Petrescu's marksmen are ranging far to ensure that any greenskin that claps eyes on the Expedition don't live to tell the tale. Assist them.
[*] Help Esbern teach Seija to Dispel.
[*] Ask him to teach Johann to Dispel.

[*] Purchase the Helldrake scales (100 gc).
[*] Purchase the strange Lustrian eggs (200 gc).
[*] Do not purchase the title of a Border Princess.



The more time you spend with the dwarves, the more sick you grow of humans. A dwarf mistrusts magic, but your deeds are enough that most will accept you regardless, especially among the Rangers. But a peasant - and the overwhelming majority of the forces under Petrescu are peasants - is filled with equal parts superstitious fear and religious disgust for magic and its wielders, and the deeds you've done seem only to inflame their suspicions. So you work with Ulthar and his men, slotting yourself into the roster and being assigned a section of the landscape to sweep.

This portion of the Border Princes is not quite the Badlands, but still noticeably more barren than the territory you've been marching through so far. The landscape is filled with wickedly thorned bushes that scratch in vain against the form of your shadowhorse, and apart from that sparse scrubs lend the only texture to jagged landscape. An army on the march here could be seen for miles from the column of dust it would kick up, so the area to be swept for greenskins is huge. You cloak yourself in concealing magics and ride with ease across what would otherwise be a punishing landscape, your horse caring not a jot for thorns and gullies that would torment a mortal beast.

Glamorous work, it isn't. You spend a couple of days doing nothing but spooking wild goats, and then on the third day you spot a single goblin trying to hunt those goats. You effortlessly ride down and decapitate the hapless greenskin, which livens things up for all of a minute, and you bring the head back to camp to add to the growing pile and get a series of approving nods. It doesn't seem to have any purpose, but the dwarves seem to derive a great satisfaction from a pile of greenskin heads and as long as you avoid being downwind of it you can see a certain charm to it.

And then it's back to patrolling an empty landscape for greenskins that just refuse to appear and distract you from the boredom of it all.

[Greenskin wanderings: 78]
[Ulthar's Rangers: 97]

Journeymen teaching journeymen is the sort of thing that never ends well for anyone involved, but needs must, so you encourage Esbern to share his knowledge of it with Seija and oversee it to hopefully leap onto any mistakes in it. Esbern's teachings are quiet but confident, and it seems that the two of them are used to discussing Ghur. You don't spot any problems with his teaching of it, and by the third day Seija has begun trying to manifest the magic to puncture Esbern's spells. You leave the two of them to it, and move on to Maximilian. Which proves to be rather trickier.

"No," he says flatly without looking up at the book. "Not happening." You try to probe further, and all you get is an equally flat "he knows what he did."

Well.

[Esbern's teaching: 55]
[Your supervision: 51+20=71]
[Convincing Maximilian: Diplomacy, 4+10=14]

The Expedition camps at the far side of the first tributary, the 'temporary' bridge proving more solid than many permanent ones you've seen in the Empire. The Ironclaw Orcs, as far as you can tell, have yet to detect you; however, they can't fail to notice how many of their fellows have gone missing, since the piles of heads left in the Expedition's wake show that everyone but you has harvested bountiful crops of greenskin hunters and wanderers. There's another tributary ahead to be bridged, and then the river itself needs to be crossed; if all goes well the Expedition is two weeks from the lost riverport and the entrance to the Underway.


Choose as many as you wish from the below; the THREE with the most votes will be Mathilde's actions for the coming week. Any purchases you make will not take actions.

Contributing to the Campaign:
[ ] Forces have been sent ahead once more to bridge a second inconvenient tributary; join them and aid in standing guard against any that may try to stop you.
[ ] Ulthar's Rangers and Petrescu's marksmen are continuing to range far to ensure that any greenskin that claps eyes on the Expedition don't live to tell the tale. Assist them further.
[ ] If any resistance does start to gather, they will be smashed apart by the very heavy cavalry of the Knightly Orders. Stand ready with them.
[ ] Volunteer to ride ahead and scout this long-lost port.
[ ] Volunteer to perform a sweep further out so you can spot any substantial forces that might be marching in your direction.
[ ] Have Ulthar handpick his best sharpshooters to be equipped with envenomed bolts.


Spend time with the Council of War:
[ ] Thane Skaroki Grimbrow
[ ] Master Engineer Durin Wutokri
[ ] Grand Master Sigwald Kriegersen
[ ] Grand Master Ruprecht Wulfhart
[ ] Marksman Codrin Petrescu
[ ] Marshal Titus Muggins


Other Preparations:
[ ] You've heard that greatswords and greataxes are near identical in the way they're used, and you happen to be surrounded by experts in the art of the axe. Learn how to use one.


Spend time with your Journeymanlings:

Esbern and Seija of the Amber Order
[ ] Test their skills in battle.
[ ] Continue to supervise the dispelling lessons.
[ ] Work with them to see if your eggs can be encouraged to hatch.

Maximilian de Gaynesford of the Gold Order
[ ] Ask him to reforge your sword into a superior one.
[ ] Introduce him to the dwarven smiths so he can try to convince them to teach him.
[ ] Ask the smiths to teach him as a favour to you (-2 favours)

Johann of the Gold Order
[ ] Help him find a place with the dwarf artillery crews so that he can supplement their abilities in combat.
[ ] Keep tabs on his interactions with the dwarves, making sure he's not fishing for information that the dwarves want to keep for themselves.

- A short and uneventful turn; such is the will of the dice.
