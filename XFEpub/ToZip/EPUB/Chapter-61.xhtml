A glass kiln is easy enough to make; doubly so when there's plenty of manpower that you can borrow from one of your fellow councillors, triply so when it's actually dwarfpower. The difficult part is heating it - you've no charcoal and not enough time to make it. Luckily, far above you all there exists all the energy one could ever ask for; all you need is to know how to harness it.

You concentrate, and Ulgu solidifies into a darkened lens. That's the easy part. Sweat beads on your brow as you slowly and steadily expand it, the shadow cast by it growing steadily. A small crowd of men and dwarves watch from what they consider a safe distance, edging away from the shadow as it approaches, and you've warned them not to look directly at the light so when they do it'll be entirely their own fault. Within the kiln, the focal point glows brighter and brighter as more and more sunlight is redirected into it. The rest of it isn't magic, but it resembles it: sand is made to run like honey and then formed into useful shapes, and when it cools again it is no longer a loose collection of grains, but instead glass.

Panoramia chatters away as she gathers molten glass on the end of her blowpipe, interrupted only briefly by having to blow down it to form the shapes desired. Airtightness, she explains with enthusiasm, is one of the key useful properties of glass; being water-tight, too, goes without saying, but she says it anyway. The slow march of rot can be ceased by proper storage; seeds kept in one's pocket will grow damp and try to sprout and inevitably die, but seeds kept in a phial sealed with wax will keep indefinitely. The same goes for the finished product: apart from the obvious advantage of not spilling as easily, a potion once brewed will keep much longer in a glass bottle than in, say, a tankard. And a bottle one has blown themselves is known to be completely sterile - if you used an old wine bottle to keep your potions in, who knows how leftover traces of wine will interact with the potion?

The gathered crowd disperses once they realize you're not going to do anything more interesting than fuel a kiln, though the dwarves do nod to themselves at such a sensible use for the suspect manling art of wizardry.

[Unescorted Gathering: 12, 98]

A few days later, Panoramia ambushes you as you return to camp, cheerfully reporting her progress; you're not sure if she considers you invested since you helped make the bottles or if she's latched onto you as a mentor figure. Her delves into the Forest of Gloom were largely uneventful, but progress was severely limited by having to skirt widely around tracts of giant spider territory. Finally, she stumbled across something that made the trip worthwhile: a lake covered in competing plant life, and in the center, a dense growth of flowers, of a shade of purple so dark that it seems black. You only covered the basics of poisons at College, but this one certainly came up: the black lotus, the source of the most popular domestic poison in the Empire, available to any foolish enough to venture into the deepest parts of the forests of the Southern Empire.

"I've never heard of them growing this big," she reports happily. "The piranhas must have kept the goblins from harvesting them, and a few had well-developed seed heads." She shows you a phial filled with bulbous lotus seeds, each the same dark purple as the flower. "Poisons are just the flip side of potions, and can be just as useful."

Among dwarves, to be a Ranger is to be as un-dwarflike as one can be while still contributing to the good of the Hold. To spend months in the sunlight and the open air, to deal regularly with other races, to skirmish and ambush and employ all sorts of underhanded tactics instead of meeting the enemy head-on; this is the role of the Ranger. Ulthar Alriksson greets you warmly as you intrude on the planning session with Marksman Petrescu; Petrescu follows suit with some hesitation, clearly uncomfortable in your presence. You can guess why: his is a Sylvanian name.

With minimal input from Petrescu, Ulthar outlines the current plan: to patrol the length of the river, from the bridge behind you to the point ahead where Barak Varr's patrols will meet yours. If the forest goblins want to fight, they'll have to bridge the river to avoid the ravenous inhabitants, and that will take time. Time enough, in theory, for patrolling forces to spot the attempt and sound the alarm. It's simple enough that you're not sure how you can contribute except for adding another pair of eyes, until you spot a stack of spare horns, the type used by the scouts to signal an attack.

Normally, enchanting is a long and drawn-out process; the reason for this is that magic really doesn't like to be trapped in one place doing one thing indefinitely. (Talking about magic as if it had desires rather than just a nature is useful shorthand, but whether it is actually true is the source of a great deal of debate.) Trapping it temporarily to do something once, on the other hand, is magnitudes easier - and magnitudes more when the desired effect is the sort of petty magic apprentices begin their education with. You get the hesitant okay of your fellow councillors and then begin to gather your will as they watch uneasily, neither dwarf nor Sylvanian entirely comfortable around magic.

[Enchanting the horns: Learning, 78+20=98]

Your demonstration of it, however, may go some way to allaying their fears. Theoretically, any type of wizard could achieve this effect, as it requires magic for power but not for direction. But Ulgu is especially suited, and it allows you to change the very nature of the sound produced so that not only is it louder, but that it would not fade in volume for dozens of miles. They are only good for a single blow apiece, but that is all that will be needed, for all from Averland to Barak Varr will hear this alarm.

Petrescu goes one way up the river to distribute the empowered horns, and you join Ulthar as he goes the other. He has a pony that he uses when the steady pace of a dwarf isn't sufficient, and at your offer and after a great deal of thought, he leaves it behind in favour of a shadowhorse you summon for him. At first he has the grim expression of a dwarf expecting to suffer for the good of his hold, but eventually concedes that he's ridden on worse.

As you ride together, he engages in the favourite pastime of dwarves, at least when there's no ale around: boasting about their home hold. The Hornhold, he tells you, is built at the site of a natural series of caves which howled in the wind, so the dwarves carefully carved out the interior and added enormous valves and gates so that they could sound it at will. He also goes some way into the geopolitics, which is apparently quite involved - instead of being a single kingdom, it is surrounded by splinter holds built atop one vein of metals or another, but they remain linked together in a dozen different ways by oath and by blood. As it was still young when the Time of Woes started, it was never linked into the Underway, which means it never fell prey to the thaggoraki despite being so close to their origin.

"Thaggoraki," you repeat, half to yourself. You've heard that word before. "Beastmen?"

He opens his mouth to reply, then pauses. "While 'aye' would not be incorrect," he says thoughtfully, "It doesn't quite communicate the nature of the vermin. The beastmen that lurk in the woods of your Empire are a very different breed to those that burrow beneath the earth. They are ratmen, boundless in number; in your tongue, they are called Skaven."

The words echo unpleasantly in your head, and grow. A thought unfolds uncomfortably in your mind, and you're taken back to a day forgotten some fifteen years ago. A voice, unfamiliar to you, droning in a bored voice. "Number thirty-two. The Ratmen and the Conspiracy of Silence. If you believe you are accessing this memory in error, please contact the Grey College at your earliest convenience." Information blossoms, summoned by a name erased from history. A terrible enemy, an empire underground. Numbers, mutability, wizardry, technology, stealth, poison, disease, all the ingredients to wipe out humanity, missing only one: unity. Knowledge suppressed so that they felt secure enough to war among themselves. Emperor Mandred, whose death plunged the Empire into centuries of civil war, slain by ratman assassins. Once he was known as the Skavenslayer; now he is the Ratslayer, and given another century or two, perhaps he will be the Beastslayer.

You swallow, and taste blood. "Them," you say faintly. "I know of them."

[Do the goblins make a move? 14]
[Scout results: 98+10(horns)=108]

The next day, the greenskins make their move, and a horn to challenge the Hornhold sounds. A hundred thousand men and dwarves on the march screeching to a halt and trying to about face is not a pretty sight, but the chain of command quickly leaps into action in trying to restore order and those of you fortunate enough to be mounted race ahead. You easily outstrip the others and are the first to arrive at a point where a dwarven ranger is staring with a mix of surprise and satisfaction across the river at a scene of terrible carnage, as hundreds of spiders happily bind dead, dying and paralyzed goblins in web.

"The greenskins were gathering," he says distractedly, "So I blew the horn, and before you got here they did." He waves vaguely in the direction of the spiders. "That's only some of them. The rest of them were chasing the goblins as they ran away."

You stare at the spiders. One of them stares back at you. You can almost see the arachnid thought patterns as it tries to figure out whether it can get across the river. Then it apparently decides that a bird in the pedipalps is worth any number in the bush, and turns back to join its fellow in feasting.

The unofficial motto of the Colleges of Magic: when in doubt, act mysterious. Your smug smile is fixed in place as the first of the other riders arrives.

+2 Dwarf Rep: The Spider Incident

Currently, Barak Varr is one week of marching away. The far side of the river is no longer full of gloomy forest - now it gives way to the open plains theoretically under control of various Border Princes and sometimes under the control of the Bloody Spears tribe of Night Goblins. You have begun to pass patrols from Barak Varr. The road is most likely safe here.

The three of the below with the most votes will be your actions over the coming week.


Contributing to the Campaign:
[ ] Rangers appreciate an anticlimactic victory. Enchant a spider-horn for them to commemorate it. (+rep)
[ ] Have Ulthar handpick his best sharpshooters to be equipped with envenomed bolts.
[ ] There's a fork ahead, with a bridge across the Skull River. Join the Grand Masters in riding ahead and guarding it, just in case.


Spend time with the Council of War:
[ ] King Belegar Ironhammer
[ ] Master Runelord Kragg the Grim (?)
[ ] Thane Skaroki Grimbrow
[ ] Master Engineer Durin Wutokri
[ ] Grand Master Sigwald Kriegersen
[ ] Grand Master Ruprecht Wulfhart
[ ] Marksman Codrin Petrescu
[ ] Marshal Titus Muggins


Other Preparations:
[ ] You've heard that greatswords and greataxes are near identical in the way they're used, and you happen to be surrounded by experts in the art of the axe. Learn how to use one.
[ ] Barak Varr has a number of Runepriests, and Kragg the Grim himself is marching with the Expedition. There's not likely to be a better time to commission a runic item (Specify: type of item, desired effect, number of favours to be spent)


Spend time with your Journeymanlings:

Esbern and Seija of the Amber Order
[ ] Test their skills in battle.

Panoramia of the Jade Order
[ ] The Forest of Gloom is still accessible if you summon a horse for her. Guard her as she ventures back into the Forest of Gloom to hunt for useful ingredients.

Maximilian de Gaynesford of the Gold Order
[ ] Ask him to reforge your sword into a superior one.
[ ] Introduce him to the dwarven smiths so he can try to convince them to teach him.
[ ] Ask the smiths to teach him as a favour to you (-2 favours)

Johann of the Gold Order
[ ] Help him find a place with the dwarf artillery crews so that he can supplement their abilities in combat.
[ ] Now that you know (well, remember) a little more, a certain suspicion is growing. Pin him down and ask his intentions regarding Skaven technology.
[ ] Keep tabs on his interactions with the dwarves, making sure he's not fishing for information that the dwarves want to keep for themselves.
