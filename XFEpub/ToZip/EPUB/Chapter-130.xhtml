    <h2>The Battle of the Caldera, Part 2</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[X] Karak Eight Peaks calls for aid.
[X] Plan Go and See
-[X] Mathilde will scout a location personally: Under-Karag Yar
-[X] Keep gyrocopters in reserve.
-[X] Kvinn-Wyr
-[X] Karagril-Karak Drazh Underway
-[X] Under-Karagril



With the Caldera clear and the Karak's forces standing idle, you delay any movement into enemy territory pending proper scouting so you can know whether Eshin or Mors is winning the battle, and whether the Red Fang Orcs are still besieging Under-Karagril via the Underway. You also point some Rangers towards scouting the remaining defences of Under-Karagril and checking to see if recent events have stirred the Kvinn-Wyr trolls up, so you know whether you need to reinforce the Kvinn-Wyr Wall or whether you can strip it of defences to shore up the other fronts.

Having given your orders and made sure the remaining chain of command is clear should you fail to return in a timely manner - Gunnars, then Princess Edda, then the Thane of Clan Angrund, all via the ironclad precedents that have put you in charge - you set off to see to the battle taking place under Karag Yar, where the most militarized of the Skaven Clans is charging into the prepared defences of the most cunning of the Skaven Clans.

[Clan Mors vs Clan Eshin: Martial vs Intrigue, 95+20+10(Desperation)+10(Preparation)=135 vs 28+25+20(Heavy Preparations)=73.]
[Opportunity? Intrigue: 88+22+5(Tactics - Skaven)=115.]

As you make your way deeper into Under-Karag Yar, you regret more and more that you missed the opening stages of this battle as you piece together the duelling artistry on display: the martial brilliance of the Warlord of Clan Mors, and the mastery of assymetrical warfare from whoever rules this outpost of Clan Eshin. You pass the results of innumerable ambushes, volleys, poisonings, explosions, betrayals, rockfalls, pits of sharpened stakes, and unleashed monsters on your way deeper into Under-Karag Yar, and though every one of them reaped a toll from the attackers, they certainly didn't stop them, and more and more of the piled corpses are wearing the tight-fitting cloth and leather of Night and Gutter Runners instead of the rags of Clanrats and the metal plate of Stormvermin.

You finally reach the ongoing battle, which by your estimate is about a quarter of the way towards the center of Clan Eshin's territory, and under cover of invisibility and intangibility you take in the entire scattered line of battle. Instead of the hit-and-run they prefer, Clan Eshin have been forced to match blade against blade, and though each of the Gutter Runners are carving through at least five times their number before falling, discipline and numbers are winning out against sheer skill. You witness the terrifying sight of multiple Eshin assassins working in concert, as a trio of the elite of Clan Eshin tear through scores of Stormvermin before melting away before guns or a swarm of Clanrats can be deployed. You also see in person something the Colleges still debate the existence of: an Eshin Sorcerer, a blur of shifting colours as it tears through armour and flesh with a crystal blade in one claw and projecting clouds of putrid smoke and envenomed sparks of magical energy with the other.

And finally, you see opportunity. The full leadership and all the resources of Clan Mors are spread out before you, and Eshin elites that normally exist only in rumour and nightmare are visible on the battlefield. You could give the battlefield a nudge one way or the other, or you could take advantage of the chaos to add to your growing collection of Skaven artefacts.

[ ] Attempt to capture a Clan Eshin Sorcerer for study. (???)
[ ] Attempt to assassinate Warlord Sleek Sharpwit of Clan Mors. (Risky)
[ ] Attempt to assassinate Clan Eshin Assassins. (Risky)
[ ] Attempt to assassinate a Clan Eshin Sorcerer. (Risky)
[ ] Assassinate every Clan Mors Fangleader and Chieftain you can safely pick off. (Probably Safe)
[ ] Assassinate every Clan Eshin Deathrunner and Chieftain you can safely pick off. (Probably Safe)
[ ] Push further into Eshin territory and grab whatever you can while things are chaotic. (Probably Safe)
[ ] With the full resources of Clan Mors on display, search for whatever is most complicated and interesting. (Probably Safe)
[ ] Check the battlefields for any Skaven artefacts of interest currently lying unattended. (Almost Certainly Safe)
[ ] Do nothing, return to the Citadel. (Safe)


- Unless you choose something from the list that goes badly here, you will return to the Citadel in time for the next battle 'turn' at the in-universe time of 12pm.
