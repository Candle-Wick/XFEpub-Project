It was not a request. It was a <i>demand</i>. One that was, for a wonder, accepted. Only in such dire times would the response be accession and not rejection coupled with punishment. Only with one of their peers gone missing under most unwholesome circumstances. Vast vaults of genetic material - gathered over the course of ten thousand years - finally released, held and protected in route by the entire Chapter Fleet available and then far more besides with the arrival of their successors. A world, a number of worlds, all embattled and their people’s hardened by the meaty fist of the ork. Where their leader had disappeared none knew, far more remained yet fighting if demoralized and scattered as much as orks could be. For a time at least, until the implantations began. It was a dark and small mirror to a time of hope turned disaster in ages past, yet for this minute step there was no intervention by the twisting coils of another. Or at least none that were immediately detected. It was, most frustratingly, seemingly timed alongside the moments when the roars of warlord himself seemed to bellow back into the ears of the greenskins, knocking 'sense' into their heads and gathering them up properly once more from some distant place in the galaxy.<br/>
<br/>
From ash, as akin to a phoenix, they rose from the shadows and struck in all direction.<br/>
<br/>
A sector relieved, the splinter fleet’s hive ships destroyed from within at the center of their formation. The ensuing chaos amongst the tyranids was more than enough for the Navy to take advantage, relieving beleaguered defenders and beginning to rebuild what was broken.<br/>
<br/>
A growing WAAAGH!! broken, a prospective leader killed in front of his followers when he stepped upon a series of explosives planted in the darkness of the night before. What might have revitalized what was lost before the defenders of Deliverance was left strangled in its cradle.<br/>
<br/>
A rebelling governor, fearful and sure that the Imperium had turned away forever, slain along with the Tau ambassadors who had come to welcome the planet into another civilization’s arms.<br/>
<br/>
A renegade fleet, its Admiral lost to delusions of grandeur nurtured by his corrupted children, brought back to the light of the Emperor by force. The corridors of the ships would take months to completely clean out the blood of the traitors, but the return of a battlefleet was more than enough to accept the cost in cleaning chemicals. The Admiral was granted the mercy of an hour long interrogation before a quick death.<br/>
<br/>
Three minor orkish empires which had sprung up in the fall and disappearance of the grand leader they’d followed throughout the Segementum collapsed into infighting as their mightiest warriors were slain. Their defenses were sabotaged in turn, destroyed, or turned against them, inflaming the fighting further. When the Imperial Navy arrived, ferrying a grim Guard who had readied themselves to die in their millions, they instead came upon targets that had been laid bare and vulnerable to them.<br/>
<br/>
One company flew to one location, another company to another. Weaned in the darkness and rituals of their kind, given experience in scope and quality to drown out whatever weakness their youth would have conveyed, they fought on. Some minor philosophers had long stated that in these days it felt as if the shadows of war hung over the whole of the galaxy, and yet it was in those same shadows that they arrived and fell upon the enemy in silence. There was no time for accolades, though they came all the same. No time to wait on ceremony, somewhat insulting a dozen and more Lords and Ladies Sector for their denials to attend rewarding feasts or balls. Once, in passing, they found the mysterious ones known as the Carcharodons performing their own bloody work, slaughtering an entire alien race from end to end of their home solar system after they had dared to infringe upon the Imperium’s borders out of inability to comprehend the scope of the titan they supped upon - the sharks having accepted the target in lieu of the Deathwatch's ability to do the same. At another time, they found the Rock itself, striking against a world taken by a furtive and cowardly lord of Chaos who had thought to take advantage of the lack of foes around him.<br/>
<br/>
They aided neither, for their aid was not needed.<br/>
<br/>
Their vengeance was cold and merciless, bereft utterly of the boastings of the disappeared wolves, or of the heartfelt words and speeches of the Blood Angels. They were silent death, arriving and disappearing immediately after achieving their objectives. So, then, were they contacted by the Inquisition. Some of the younger men and women of that clandestine organization dared to threaten, or to overly question just why the High Lords had acquiesced to the demand and the opened vaults. They did not live long, for they were silenced by their own superiors, who saw instead the desperate need and aid that could be given. For the price of pride, the Imperium itself might live, these wiser one’s thought to themselves. The Imperium over all. As such, as the years stretched on, preparations were put in place. Slow, agonizingly slow campaigns of observation and subterfuge were performed by the only ones who could.<br/>
<br/>
At the stroke of the sixty third year of the forty second millennium, they struck. Where single groups and small handfuls had failed, companies succeeded. Where a Watch Fortresses compliment struggled, a Chapter followed through. Not one, but three, Successors who had joined their forefathers at Deliverance giving just that to those who cried out for salvation and the destruction of the alien. In the blink of an eye, relatively at least, there was genocide. A bloody trough of it, souls and flesh burned to ash or wilting utterly from toxins and poisons built specially along lines of genetic code and organic dispensation. Those that required more exotic methods of execution received them, careful formulation and dispensation given to wield things that would have otherwise demanded execution and summary destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Some pleaded for their lives. They did not know what they had done, they said, they had not thought the stories their captives told them were true. Such a large Imperium could not exist! Others did not care, and instead saw it as a chance to attain vengeance against those who had wronged them in the past. Others tried to bargain, offering up all they could and more to try and stave off their incoming destruction. None survived. None could be <i>allowed</i> to survive. For the insult they had offered, by their invasions and their sheer existence, there could be no other answer but complete and total extermination. They were no mere scalpel in the darkness, but an ebony blade, gleaming not at all yet striking with indelible purpose.<br/>
<br/>
But where there was darkness, there was also light.<br/>
<br/>
The aliens had dearly threatened, and by their actions and their existence they demanded their own destruction. The Lectio Diviniatus was clear on this. The Convent Prioris had seen what had come, and knew what needed to be done. A vast number of their mighty arms had been sent elsewhere, following the Living Saint Celestine. But more could be raised. More <i>would</i> be raised. What else could be done when such an incredible number of orphans had been left behind by the predations of the heretic and the alien? Why, nothing but to train and arm them in faith and hatred of course. Preceptories had swollen to bursting, in numbers not seen in an age, screaming their faith to the Emperor. Holy hatred, it was, holy hatred indeed. They confessed their sins, their weakness, and it was purged from them by the holy word of the Confessors.<br/>
<br/>
Decius XXIII, Ecclesiarch of the Adeptus Ministorum, declared a mighty and grand War of Faith, starting within Segmentum Tempestus, and to flood outwards in all directions once their holy work was complete. For too long had the Imperium allowed the alien infested Segmentum to be as such, with foes such as the Dark Gods demanding their attentions elsewhere. It could not be allowed any further. They spread out, then, and enacted destruction and genocide in equal measure, burning a dozen civilizations on their birth worlds as pyres dedicated to the glory of the God-Emperor. They died as well, in their hundreds, in the process. But each death was in honor of the God-Emperor, and they died fighting. A hundred mighty fists, tightly gripped flamers, great gouts of cleansing holy fire spreading in tendrils from Ophelia VII, and more came. Those that had surrendered to the xeno were made to repent, with violence or arco-flagellation. Those that still fought on were given succor and proud aid.<br/>
<br/>
Where Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka had gone, none knew. But he was not found in the camps of slain warlords and warbosses who had trailed him from Octarius to Deliverance. There were reports that the ork empires of the galactic northeast had begun growing in power, that the Arch-Dictator of Gathrog and Great Despot of Dregruk had put aside their long-standing war to join together and face other foes, but none knew for certain the truth of these. What did matter was that Tempestus burned with holy fire, both within and soon enough without of the Imperium’s borders. That it was whispered that a Living Saint had risen amongst their number as the War of Faith illuminated – by force more often than not – the way through Segmentum Pacificus.<br/>
<br/>
This was, in fact, not true at all.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, they had found a Saint who had already risen. Or perhaps it would be better to say that the Saint found them.<br/>
<br/>
Clad in golden armor, with the light of the Emperor flowing from one hand and an eternally blazing sword in the other, Saint Sabbat welcomed those who came to assist in the final and total reclamation of the worlds that bore her name. She bore no wings, for she was yet the shepherd who walked amongst those she fought alongside, even now. And where she stepped, the faithful followed. The Sabbat Worlds Crusade ended gloriously and finally, and though she wept to leave them behind – her holy tears of blood collected preciously – she knew that she could not remain. She made a short pilgrimage to many of the worlds she had fought and liberated, twice now, save for one world for which she blessed alone. She named it New Tanith, that world, and granted it to some single regiment of the Imperial Guard for no discernable reason to those that now followed her after the death of the last Warmaster of the Crusade in the closing moments of the forty first millennium. Yet none spoke against her, and instead honored her wish that the world be protected, before she took up arms once more. The city of Ibrahm's Valor added its own 1st Tanith Regiment to it all, soon to be joined by others.<br/>
<br/>
Saint Sabbat set forth, heading that War of Faith, across far more than but the Sabbat Worlds, but the south through much of the Segmentum Pacificus into Segmentum Tempestus, and where she arrived there was light. Where she stepped, the darkness retreated, and under her hands the dying were brought succor and life. She was not the fiery tempest of destruction that some thought she would be, but rather it was by her words that she brought salvation. For all of her light, there were great shadows as well, and within those she knew where her allies lurked. Only once did she meet with them, in a meeting recorded by those who had elected to attempt to chronicle every moment, upon a hill of slain orks who had fallen upon each other after their leaders had been killed. A single nod was given by the one known as Kayvaan Shrike, yet instead was greeted by a hand. One he shook, despite what some thought might have been a bought of uncomfortableness. It did not show, of course. To, perhaps, any but Saint Sabbat. Yet she said nothing, her smile kind.<br/>
<br/>
Then they both stepped away, one to the light, the other into the shadows, and yet both fought on in tandem. Threats yet remained. Too many, as ever. There were still the immense remains of the Great WAAAGH!! which still roiled in the Segmentum. Dozens of new alien threats and races. The Necrons, their dynasties and eldritch technologies growing stronger and stronger as more was remembered and awoken once more from their deathless sleep. The tyranids, ever hungry, had begun to creep through in greater numbers than ever seen before across all of Tempestus. But, for now, the Raven Guard and their sons fought on, invigorated like never before, the shadows cast by the passage of the Saint Sabbat their ally. Chaos was, remarkably, largely absent. In that there were only a few Chaos Lords, cults, sorcerer enthrallments, and such to take care of. A pittance compared to those fighting in the 13th Black Crusade.</div>
