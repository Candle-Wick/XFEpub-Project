There is simply something odd, to you at least, in watching a Magos of the normally so passionless and distant Mechanicus glorifying in setting piles of dead orks aflame. You have heard the corrupted and dark laughter of the insane, the giggles of daemons, the grunts of amusement from xenos, and more. But you had never heard maniacal laughter in the techna-lingua before. You are not sure that you ever wished to. Regardless, with the Magos satisfied, your oath satisfied, and the knowledge that some of the chapter’s ships will be repaired secure in your mind, you order all of the Chapter present to lift off. The two brothers of 5<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company that were injured will be healed by next year, while Apollo’s wounds will be healed in transit thanks to the masterful work of the Apothecarium.<br/>
<br/>
You leave Trontiux II to be reclaimed by the Mechanicus, whose zealotry will likely involve them very carefully removing every last spore of the vile greenskins. To the best of their ability at the least. However much the Knights may wish to have kept some preserved so that they had something to cut their teeth upon, the Mechanicus who holds their leash will more likely than not refuse that to them. Not when so many of their holy machines have been harmed and desecrated by the grubby hands of ork meks. After exchanging some few words between you and the heads of the Houses you rescued with your forces, the Blood Ravens depart.<br/>
<br/>
It was only two years ago that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company left Subsector Aurelia. Two years ago that they descended into one of the most uncertain of battlefields to be found in this galaxy of endless war, that of a Forgeworld abandoned and gone wild. You left them with their captain, untested and unproven to his veteran brethren, on a belief and hope that he would prove himself. Isador would have said that trite phrase of his, that hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, but you take some small relish in defying the traitorous creature not just in physical action but in thought as well.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, when you arrive in-system, that small part of doubt within you is ground beneath your boot at the welcome sight of the <i>Omnis Arcanum</i> and the rest of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company Fleet present in orbit, none of which appear to be terribly damaged or changed from the last time you saw them. It is a heartening thing to observe, at the least, a strong fleet emblazoned with the sigil of the Blood Ravens rather than the faltering and crumbling force that made up your Chapter just after the purge completed. In point of fact, as you watch on the auspex, they are currently deploying their Thunderhawks down to the surface, with an accompanied burst of heat and static on sensors signifying the deployment of tarantula turrets from the bellies of the Thunderhawks.<br/>
<br/>
“Receiving communications, Chapter Master,” a serf speaks up, and at your nod he manipulates the controls to allow a holo-display of a marine who is largely unknown to you to fizzle into existence before the Command Throne.<br/>
<br/>
The armor itself is heavily pitted and scarred, but it is the astartes’ face which captures your gaze. It is a, surely to a mortal man, a horrifying mass of scar tissue, some gone white and others red with freshness, lumps and bruises upon his flesh making it almost impossible to see any specific feature on his face. The nose has been torn and beaten and squashed as to appear to be almost invisible slits against the morass of tortured flesh, eyes largely concealed by swollen ropes and calluses on the brow and cheeks, and it is not until the marine opens their mouth that you can even find that feature itself. So troubling is it, that for an instant that soon stretches on, you find your suspicion aroused quite heavily indeed. Could there be yet more traitors, more violently mutated blights yet upon your Chapter?<br/>
<br/>
The fleet which first appeared so welcoming is doused in your suspicion, and it does not escape you that it could easily crush your own forces if it so chose on sheer firepower. It is only the fact that an Ark Mechanicus with its own bevy of strike cruisers and frigates surrounding it sits nearby that keeps you from acting as you otherwise might.<br/>
<br/>
“Chapter Master,” the marine thumps his fist to his chest, head bowing to you, before he straightens. “Have operations on Trontiux finished so quickly-” he begins, his voice gargled by obvious wounds on his throat that look to have been fatal.<br/>
<br/>
“Identify yourself first, marine,” you interrupt, fingers tapping down along the length of <i>God Splitter</i>.<br/>
<br/>
The marine pauses, and though you simply are forced to go more by body language than facial expression – for there is none to be seen – the marine appears shocked. Then a hand reaches up to perhaps touch at his face before it drops out of sight again, the marine’s spine visibly straightening.<br/>
<br/>
“I…apologize, Chapter Master. It,” the marine pauses and then starts again, head turning aside slightly, “It is I, Marcus Crixus.”<br/>
<br/>
His words stun you, your jaw working as you suddenly reexamine the armor, the…face, such as it is, that blasted wasteland of flesh and scar tissue. Now that you can see it, the flesh is slightly decolored and after you carefully observe with your cybernetic eye you realize it is the single service stud present for the youthful former assault marine. But the wounds upon this face are…horrific. Mortal, surely.<br/>
<br/>
“How…,” your words fail you, your mind so busied as it is with marveling over what must have occurred to him. “No,” you shake your head. “It is no matter. Report on your situation, Brother-Captain.”<br/>
<br/>
“I,” Marcus bows, “I understand. It is little surprise that I am…unrecognizable to you, Chapter Master. Yet I still bear the blade you bestowed upon me,” and he demonstrates as such, stepping back slightly to unsheathe <i>Wisdom</i> and let its gleaming light put more credence onto his identity.<br/>
<br/>
Though you do not yet know if you can fully trust it.<br/>
<br/>
“It is the truth,” a more familiar voice speaks up, and you relax slightly as your Chief Librarian steps into the frame, his force staff crackling power that carries across a scent of ozone into the bridge despite the distance between your ships. “The young captain,” Justinius looks at you gravely, “Has suffered much in the course of guiding his company, with strength, honor, and skill.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then that is enough for me. And yet again, I ask for your report on the situation,” you intone, arms folding behind your back.<br/>
<br/>
“Very well,” Marcus, his voice still that terrible ragged thing.<br/>
<br/>
And so he speaks.<br/>
<br/>
Forgeworld Aerus is as bad as you suspected, and worse. Insane machine spirits infect the entire structure, a result of its fall so long ago to rogue techpriests who had aligned themselves with the Dark Mechanicus. Daemon-coded machines march and fight against each other endlessly, whole possessed manufactorums endlessly sending out monstrous servitors to collect scrap of all kinds to be dragged back so that more dark machines might be birthed. Aerus itself was the subject to that most titanic of civil wars, the Horus Heresy, and it is then that it fell, a warp storm concealing it at times, lack of resources preventing others from reaching it at other times, and various other factors as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is a tainted place, much of it, at least. But the dividends paid by this conflict are already proving themselves. There are no STCs to be found, of course, all destroyed by time, but Marcus personally spearheaded multiple attacks onto the surface to clear out a staging area from and for which the Forgeworld might be reclaimed. There, he discovered a cache of incredibly valuable weapons, meant originally for delivery to the Luna Wolves – those that would be known later as the Sons of Horus and then the Black Legion. It is a type of weapon rarely seen not just in the hands of the Chapter but for the rest of the galaxy.<br/>
<br/>
Graviton weaponry.<br/>
<br/>
Marcus himself, for the act of locating the cache, was granted a graviton pistol to use himself while the rest of the weapons were remanded into the custody of the Mechanicus to check them over and ensure that they were not tainted. For indeed, Aerus was not a wholly lost world to the Dark Mechanicus, and those still loyal to the Emperor and Omnissiah managed to at least preserve some manufactorums, warehouses, and the like. At another time, a bevy of tanks were located, and at others weapons and power armors that have not been built since the Horus Heresy, all collected back into the hands of the Adeptus Mechanicus.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not to say that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company achieved all of this, battling maddened machines, the very environment itself after millennia of no maintenance, and more without any difficulty. One only needs to look upon the devastated ruin that was once Marcus’ face to see that, but it extends beyond him. The battle in question was facing a creature that might once have been a noble dreadnought shell, one of the advanced and lost Centurion design, had it not been twisted by boiling black flesh and spewing acid breath and sickly yellow steam from its seams.<br/>
<br/>
And, in its final act of destruction, it wielded a weapon that even you shudder to contemplate using.<br/>
<br/>
Phosphex.<br/>
<br/>
It wielded a phosphex explosive like a grenade in its suicidal death throes, and while three brothers were slain, Marcus survived in saving the rest of the forces with him at the time by forcing the daemon-machine back singlehandedly before it could detonate the weapon. This, then, is responsible for his appearance. They had to cut away at the flesh of his face, down near to the skull in some places, to prevent the burning phosphex from ending his life. Even then, the poison within the substance nearly drove his body to internment within a dreadnought shell had the Chief Librarian not grappled with his body and soul to prevent this.<br/>
<br/>
It was only a few months ago that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Captain managed to make it back to his feet, throwing himself back into the fight with a terrible will and thirst for vengeance against the corrupted machines that had harmed his brothers so, allowing great returns since then. As of now, a full third of the planet has been reclaimed by the Mechanicus who are fervently cleansing it as best as they can from the taint of what the Dark Mechanicus left behind, restoring facilities, power stations, perimeter sensors and defenses, and all manner of things. As for the Blood Ravens themselves, Marcus has pushed to keep the Blood Ravens mobile, constantly picking up and reestablishing a new forward operating base on the very borders between the reclaimed areas and those that are still not under control.<br/>
<br/>
The 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian Consolidated, unfortunately, have not nearly performed as well. A full half of their forces have been lost to the rampages of machines, their own equipment malfunctioning and becoming infected with the unholy scrap code which still percolates the noosphere, mutated creatures that evolved in the wastes where oceans once were before pollution caused their removal which are resistant to las weaponry and are quite fearsome in their own right. Yet they are doing their best, as best they can, though after a daemon-machine that was, on appearance, a conglomerated near-Titan crafted out of the ruined and rusting hulks of a dozen Leman Russ tanks, which tore through their lines…they are being kept within the reclaimed territory on patrols alongside the Mechanicus’s own forces.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of whom, tremendous numbers of Skitarii are constantly being deployed to fight back against the metal wilderness which resists their control over the world so viciously. Unfortunately, there is no central foe to fight, no single focal point that could possibly shatter the angry ghosts of the Heresy. Instead there are batteries of manufactorums acting as mechanical wombs for endless streams of machines and cybernetic monstrosities forged out of rotting flesh and the bodies of the various mutant creatures which have grown in number for all these thousands of years the world has been left isolated. Only the Emperor knows how this world being exposed to regular warp storms in the past may have further affected this place. At the least, like malignant growths, anti-air batteries literally sprout up out of the metal landscape like tumors, deep within the territory not held by the Mechanicus, some growing overnight, others disappearing at other times. At the least, it has made air-based assaults difficult, and a drop pod was experimentally dropped to the protests of the Tech-Marines by Marcus where it was subsequently torn to shreds before it completed the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Orbital drops, then, are likely to fail on their own. The war is restricted to the ground, for now, as to bombard the ground with the great and terrible fire that your ships and those of the Mechanicus are capable of would potentially damage relics of the past. Something that neither you nor the Mechanicus is particularly willing to do.<br/>
<br/>
But the Captain has not been idle. He regularly identifies strong points along the ‘enemy’ lines, if they can be easily classified as such, and drives his forces to reinforce the Mechanicus’ Skitarii Legions. Even now, as you have arrived, there are three separate locations that are to be struck at some point soon, hopefully at least. Knowing well that he does not have nearly the numbers that the Chapter had access to in the past, he does not dare divide his own forces on this world, where a single marine can fall just as easily as any guardsman to ambush or surprise attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Though, an additional question soon arises.<br/>
<br/>
You sent him here to prove his own authority. He was, until your arrival, the commander of all space marine forces in-system and over the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian as well. Yet, it is your place as Chapter Master to take command of all in the theatre. On the other hand, you could allow him to continue his work as 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company’s commander, leading them in battle. It is a question of authority, and his own veterancy. For sure, his near-death to a face first exposure to a phosphex bomb in order to preserve the lives of his forces has at least proved his dedication.<br/>
<br/>
Then, of course, comes other questions. This will be an extended fight. As such the Chapter must do more than simply fight here.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Aerus Mission Decisions (Authority):</u><br/>
[] Assert full authority over all Blood Ravens in system, including over the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company, pushing them all beneath your banner and your decisions.<br/>
[] Retain control over your current forces, but allow the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company more latitude and independence so that Marcus can continue to lead and prove himself.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Aerus Mission Decisions (Warfare):</u><br/>
[] Patrol the Reclaimed Zone -  Is subject to regular ambushes, machine creature infiltrators, mutated creatures appearing through ruined sewers and pipes. This will free up the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian, while allowing the Mechanicus to work with better ease at restoring the area, building up their own defenses, etc. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Target An Aerus Daemonforge - One of the tainted manufactorums which continually spill out a mixture of random possessed machinery, horrific cybernetic monstrosities, etc. behind the ‘enemy lines’ which are currently fighting against the streaming hordes of Skitarii. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Break Mad Machine Mass, a grouping of insane tanks and armored carriers whose Machine Spirits have gone mad and are traveling as one mass and attacking everyone and everything they can, heading straight for the Skitarii Lines. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
[] Attack Abominable Quasi-Titan – Aerus did not have a Titan Legion on its own, but apparently it’s twisted ghosts are determined to produce their own. Out of daemonflesh, rusted cable, and random scrap and weaponry scattered across the land, are titan-sized creatures crafted by mad machine spirits and corrupted programming. They are rare, but especially dangerous. Marcus is planning to lead the 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company in a grand strike to break the nearest one as it nears the Skitarii Lines. (Write-In Forces)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Lead Your Chapter (All Technically Available):</u><br/>

The Blood Ravens have lost so many, both fresh blood and veteran. It may aid in the rebuilding of the Chapter for you to work upon them and try to impart the skill and experience that the Blood Ravens of the past once possessed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos</u><br/>
- Remember that Chapter Master Angelos, Chief Librarian Probalis, and Apollo are mighty champions and <i>can</i> be deployed on operations. They need not remain in their ships doing nothing.<br/>
- While your Chapter rebuilds, it may be time to consider rebuilding the amount of Gene-Seed you possess through faster means i.e. test-slaves now that the <i>Omnia Arcanum</i> has been repaired.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Nero Gracchus – Chief Apothecary (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Implant Test-Slaves with Gene-Seed to harvest in 5 years. Write-In the amount of Gene-Seed you wish to use.<br/>
[] Write-In<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Nero Gracchus</u><br/>
- We are in dire need for more gene-seed!<br/>
- The Apothecarium really does need more, well, Apothecaries.<br/>
- In 007.M42, 42 Gene-Seed will be available from the Test-Slaves.<br/>
<b>- Gracchus is currently studying the gene-seed of the Blood Ravens, to perhaps improve survival rates for implantation.</b><br/>
<br/>
<u>Martellus Ravias – Master of the Forge (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Build Order (250 BP Available)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of the Forge Ravias</u><br/>
- I could use a few more peers in the forges. Or at least subordinates.<br/>
- We need a bit of everything when it comes to equipment these days.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Cyrus Octavius – Master of Recruits (Choose 1):</u><br/>
[] Send Scouts to patrol, train, and test themselves against the enemies of the Imperium to ensure they are capable of becoming full space marines in the future.<br/>
- [] To Location (Write-In)<br/>
<br/>
<u>Things To Consider – Master of Recruits</u><br/>
- Cyrus is extremely resistant to throwing his scouts into Aerus, considering how dangerous it has proven to be to even full battle brothers. With every recruit being precious, but to coddle them being equally offensive, he recommends that the 10<span style="vertical-align:super">th​</span> Company is allowed to sharpen themselves as iron on iron on the world of Trontiux III. Orks are plenty dangerous on their own, but the Scouts would at least be less likely to die a few minutes after landing.<br/>

<b>Revealed Current Goings-On Of 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company/Aerus System/Additional Information:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Due to the <i>extreme</i> deadliness of the planet, all remaining 1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Company forces have become Veterans. -15 Veterans of that 70, 10 to death, and 5 becoming Tomb-Brothers, geneseed retrieved <b>(+15)</b></li>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Marcus Crixus’s stats have changed in the following manner: Toughness Increase, Fellowship Increase, Willpower Increase, as a result of powering through what should have been a fatal Phosphex explosion and the subsequent poisoning.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Marcus Crixus has gained a personal wargear: <i>Arrow of Aerus, </i>a relic Graviton Pistol from the Horus Heresy, as a weapon, for recovering a Graviton Weapon Cache before it could be destroyed by a rampaging Daemonscrap Dreadnought.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">1<span style="vertical-align:super">st​</span> Meridian Reduced to ½ Strength currently.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Aerus is filled with mutated creatures, both of flesh and metal, abominations sprawled throughout its surface. Mechanicus is in heavy force, but is bearing the full brunt of the enemy save for the sporadic spearhead assaults by the space marines. Squads can be isolated by a changing and mutative environment, and cut down by enemies bearing weapons that date back to the Horus Heresy in deadliness. Dividing forces is <b>not</b> recommended, both by the Mechanicus forces, Guard tacticians, and the 1st Company itself.</li>
