    <h2>The Battle of Karagril, Part 1</h2>


Spoiler: Voting results



[*] APPROACH: Caldera

[*] SKIRMISH: Attempt to assassinate the Warboss
[*] SKIRMISH: Lead your Ducklings on forays into the Karag so they can bloody themselves against Orcs under your supervision



With the Eastern Valley firmly under dwarven control and Kvinn-Wyr as much an obstacle to your enemies as it is to you, further expansion has become very tricky. The only way of striking at Karagril without the possible intervention of other factions is through a climb from Death Pass, and that rules out a significant portion of your forces and could quickly become a disaster if the Orcs discovered it while it was underway. Which left two different routes, both through a no-man's-land: the Underway and the caldera. The Underway path was chiefly a battleground between Clan Mors and Clan Moulder, but Clan Skryre of Karag Zilfin and the Red Fang tribe of Karak Drazh could also get involved if they wish, and the twisting tunnels and low light of the Underway would make it trivial for them to do so if they desired. Conventional Dwarven tactics made it the default choice for an avenue of approach, but conventional Dwarven tactics haven't always applied to the extended campaign of Eight Peaks.

The caldera route is the one that you prefer. The greenskin structures that dominated it have remained abandoned ever since the Battle of the Citadel and the fire that raged through, and between the gyrocopters of Karag Lhune and the siege weapons, Thunderers and Quarrelers in the Citadel, the very few attempts to venture back into the caldera were quite firmly rebuffed. All present that paid attention to the caldera had learned either first- or second-hand that it was quite firmly under the control of the Dwarves, and would therefore be much less likely to intercede in an invasion of Karagril than those adjacent to the Karagril Underway.

The trade-off is that everyone is adjacent to the caldera. You don't know who dominates the above-ground Karag Zilfin and Karag Yar, but you do know that Clan Skryre and Eshin respectively at least dominate the subterranean portions. Karag Rhyn, as far as you know, is the only other remaining stronghold of greenskins within Eight Peaks. And you have no idea whatsoever what lurks within Karag Mhonar. But while that is a lot of potential complications for the upcoming battle, any that dare to do so would be hideously exposed to both Citadel and gyrocopter, and an unexpected battle under those circumstances would be a blessing rather than a curse.

Your words sway the debate. Prince Gotri's support of the caldera approach had focused entirely on his own gyrocopters, but with the Citadel that Dreng controls factored in he's happy with the overland route as well, and King Kazador is practically exuberant at the thought of a second or even third battle on the same day. King Belegar finalizes the decision, and the meeting breaks up with Dreng and Prince Gotri weighing how much of the Kvinn-Wyr or Eastern Gate defences could be temporarily transferred to the Citadel or the edge of the caldera.

Kragg has finally emerged, and on any other day this would cause for the long-delayed showdown between him and Thorek. But the egos of Dwarven Grandmasters are put aside on the verge of battle against their ancestral foes, and the two can be seen examining Kragg's anvil and tutting over remaining imperfections completely imperceptible to any other eye. The one concession Kragg would grant to Thorek is that he has a greater level of battle experience with Anvils of Doom, and thus has had more occasion to perform repairs on the ancient relics. Meanwhile, Thorek's Anvil is being hoisted by gyrocopters atop one of the two tallest towers of the Citadel. You've never even heard of two Anvils being deployed in a single battle, and you're starting to hope that anyone will prove foolish enough to try to get involved.

[Rolling...]

Panoramia and Maximilian are elsewhere preparing themselves for tomorrow's battle, but Johann has attached himself to the field trip into Karagril. You've taken your Ducklings into combat with greenskins before, but you sought out encounters that would ease them into it and the only exposure they've had to Orcs is when one was leading a group of goblins that you'd chosen for your students to obliterate. Orcs en masse is a different kettle of fish entirely, and you'd rather they encounter the full intersection of violence and enthusiasm that is the Orcs under your watchful eye instead of in the chaos of battle.

"Alright, class," you begin as you lead the group through the caldera, picking your way through the burned remains of greenskin shanties. "I'm winding the cheekiness down to background levels for this. It's far too easy to underestimate the Orcs. They're usually dim, sometimes seem cowardly, prone to infighting, easy to bait, and often consider strategy to be a form of cowardice. But the greenskins destroyed Solland, were partly responsible for the destruction of Drakwald, and they came close enough to destroying the Moot that now there's Halflings all the way down here. They roll through the Border Princes so often that not a single power in the Old World wants to bother with it, and it's about two provinces worth of marginal-to-okay farmland, huge amounts of timber, and a number of prime mineral deposits. If the Empire is ever destroyed, and pray to your God of choice that it never occurs, I give it one in four odds it's the greenskins that do it. So put your serious faces on and make foremost in your mind the possibility that you're about to encounter large amounts of creatures that could individually easily kill you." Grave silence meets your words, and you'd smile in pride if the topic wasn't deadly serious. "Consider," you continue, "what it would take to convince you to charge a fortified Dwarven position. Orcs do so routinely. Before your arrival, they did so multiple times and came uncomfortably close to succeeding in battles that pitched their weaknesses against Dwarven strengths. Right, Johann?"

"Battle of the Citadel, I was almost sure that the line would crumple and the Orcs were going to punch right through to the siege weapons, where I was," he says gravely. "That they didn't was so shocking that King Belegar granted all of them citizenship and named them 'Mountain Guards'. And this was while every projectile weapon we had was firing, and collectively accounting for a hundred Orcs a second or more."

"And the Dwarves take both mountains and guards with utter seriousness, so they don't grant titles like that lightly. The Orcs live for violence. They are very good at violence. Their two Gods are based on two different forms of violence. If they get half a chance they'll kill you and they'll enjoy doing so." You look over your shoulder, and are pleased that your students seem to be taking your words with the gravity they deserve. "Even an unexceptional Orc will be stronger than you, tougher than you, and will probably have more combat experience than you, and they only get bigger and nastier from there. It wouldn't surprise me if even with me and Johann watching over you, today will involve me having to heal what would otherwise be a fatal injury."

"But Ulgu can't-" Adela begins, and then cuts herself off.

"It can't heal, no," you say. "Nor can Hubert throw fireballs, nor can Gretel channel lightning. Each of us is part of the Colleges of Magic, and they're spoken of collectively because even though we sometimes squabble, we are allies. Once you've started to impress your betters and spread your name around, I strongly advise you take advantage of that fact. I spent every scrap of Wizardly goodwill that my campaign in Sylvania and my Magisterial graduation earned me on a little something from Panoramia's colleagues, and I'd have died somewhere between once and thrice over these past few years if I hadn't."

Your little speech concludes as you reach the foot of Karagril, and what had been a group of guards lies slumped in the entryway, quarrels making the cause of their demise clear. Prince Ulthar had taken the Rangers of Karak Hirn back home with him, but more than a few of what would become Clan Huzkul were also Rangers and they had learned well under his guidance. Magics swirl as a variety of spells form to hopefully come between a wizard and a violent death, and you lead your charges into Karagril.

[Finding a suitable target: Martial, 62+23+20(mapped Karagril)+10(Windsage)=115.]

Between your mapping of Karagril and your acute magical senses, you're able to find a suitable target for your students. Seven Orcs is a bit much, but Johann's unexpected charge all the way through the chamber and out of sight crash-tackles two of them out of the picture, and a single shot through the forehead takes the total down to four. Slightly outnumbered is usually the best someone could hope for when it came to Orcs, so you nudge your students into action and sit back to observe.

[Adela vs Orc: Martial, 56+12=68 vs 64+15=79.]
[Hubert vs Orc: Martial, 37+17=54 vs 39+15=54.]
[Gretel vs Orc: Martial, 98+15=113 vs 50+15=65.]

The opening volley of spells prompts the shockingly fast charge that's just one of the many shocks fighting Orcs can deliver, and you observe the unfolding chaos carefully. Adela holds her attacker off with impressively rapid-fire bolts of flame, Hubert's sword clashes with his Orc's choppa in a respectable display of skill, but it's Gretel who excels and cements her status as your favourite as one Orc stares befuddled at his choppa arm hanging limply from his body, and a second has several neat wounds torn through his torso by her summoned scythe.

[Adela vs Orc: Martial, 54+12=66 vs 82+15=97.]
[Teacher interrupt: Martial, 26+23=49 vs 52+15-20(unprepared)=47.]
[Hubert vs Orc: Martial, 89+17=106 vs 39+15=54.]
[Gretel vs Orc: Martial, 40+15=55 vs 67+15-10(Limbwither)=72.]

Adela's flaming sword flickers from an underpowered casting as it emerges from her wand, and the second of focus it takes to restore it would have gone very badly for her if your bullet from the darkness hadn't sent the Orc recoiling backwards. What you see of Hubert's swordplay gets your grudging approval as his parry sends the Orc's choppa flying and his blade makes it most of the way through the Orc's chest with a crunch of bone. Meanwhile Gretel's initial advantage is lost as her remaining Orc falls back on the fist of his off-hand, sending the slight girl tumbling backwards.

[Adela vs Orc: Martial, 30+12=42 vs 16+15-10(wounded)=21.]
[Hubert intervention: Martial, 16+17=33]
[Gretel vs Orc: Martial, 56+15-10(bruised and prone)=61 vs 9+15-10(Limbwither)=14.]

Adela's sword pushes her Orc back and starts to burn wounds in its body as Hubert looks uncertainly from one ongoing combat to the other. Gretel rises to her feet at the approach of the Orc and a smooth swing of her scythe divests him of his remaining functional arm, and the Orc looks from missing limb to non-functioning limb and yells in confused outrage.

[Adela vs Orc: Martial, 79+12=91 vs 41+15-20(heavily wounded)=36.]
[Gretel vs Orc: Learning, 9+17-5(bruised)=21.]
[Hubert intervention: Martial, 52+17=79.]

Adela's Orc gives a soft sigh as the fiery blade passes through his chest and slumps downward, his weight tearing the weapon through and out his shoulder. With one fight well and truly over, Hubert makes up his mind and turns his blade on Gretel's unarmed Orc, striking it down as Gretel fumbles with Shyish trying to tear itself free of her control.

[Gretel attempting to ground miscast: 55.]
[Rolling...]
[Teacher intervenes: Learning, 71+26=97.]

The normal procedure when a student miscasts is to stand back and pray, but recently you've done a fair bit of reading and thinking on the topic of unruly Shyish and you have no fear of Dhar. As the curdling energies within her start to concentrate in her jaw and reality begins to fray, you reach out and press your hand against her cheek, your will unable to prevent the magic from rebelling but able to at least command where it goes. As two awestruck students watch, you tear the miscast spell from Gretel's head and clutch it in your fist, where it immediately comes under the influence of Dwarven Runecraft and ignites into sullen purple flames.

"Damn easy to miscast under combat conditions," you say gravely. "What were you trying to do, Gretel?"

She rubs her jaw and takes a few tries before she's able to answer. "Steal Life, Magister," she says in a small voice. "I've done it-"

"Yes, you've done it a dozen or a hundred or a thousand times in controlled conditions." The purple fires burn low as the last of the Shyish corrodes away to Dhar and is destroyed. "Doesn't matter. If you can't give it your entire attention, don't cast a spell if you don't have to. How much damage did the Orc do? Cracked ribs, bruised organs?"

"I think just normal bruises, Magister," she says, carefully rubbing her side.

"If there wasn't a battle tomorrow, I'd say better to let them heal naturally. As is, you should take a moment to clear your head before you start snatching up the life-force of the fallen." You glance around the room. Adela's Orc is dead and so are the two Gretel had faced, but Hubert's is still stubbornly gurgling air through a lung filling with blood. "That one. You've got at least half a minute to clear your head. If you can, attempt the spell again. If you can't, we can find another and you can take your time." As Gretel walks shakily over to the last living Orc, you turn to the other two. "Decent work, Adela. Work on quick casting of that sword, or get your hands on an actual one that you don't need to wrestle with Aqshy to use. Better to be good at one of fireballs and fire-sword than half-good at both. Hubert, good swordplay but don't hesitate in combat. It takes a lot of experience to read a fight at a glance, and if you can't it's better to just pick one and hope it's the one that needs you more than hesitate and help with neither."

Watching Gretel's struggle to recenter herself in your periphery, you turn to see Johann re-enter the room, clothes tattered and fists bloody but his golden skin unmarred. "That was bracing," he says. "How'd they do?"

[Gretel's Steal Life: 91+17=108.]

You smile as you observe with Magesight as Shyish drifts into the dying Orc, wraps around what little of its life-force remains, and pulls it free of the Orc and into Gretel. "Adequate," you say. "Quite adequate."

After taking your students on a few more skirmishes, you escort them back to the entrance before wrapping yourself in Ulgu and delving far deeper into the Karag on your own. You'd spotted the current Warboss several times while scouting, and his self-proclaimed promotion from Big Boss and his attempts at cementing his authority by declaring those in the Karag to be Silver Fangs had sparked discontent and ambition in many of his underlings. His combat prowess had kept most of it from escalating into outright rebellion, but that just meant that those that consider themselves claimants to the title had accumulated, and if he was removed it was quite likely that a great many Orcs would rush to fill the vacuum and collide quite messily with each other.

With the year not quite drawn to a close, you've yet to focus the energies of Ranald's Coin to a new purpose and still fall within the protection of the Night Prowler, and with the Warboss calling himself Durnash but known to most as 'naff shiny git' too paranoid of his supposed followers to promote any of them to his bodyguard, you're able to close to easy pistol range and have ample time to consider how to get him within Branulhune's. His armour is a patchwork of chunks and flakes pried from the Silver Tower, and instead of the usual choppa he bears a mace studded with jagged chunks of the same. He's definitely leaning into his claiming of Karagril, and you're here to make him regret that before the gathering army gives him a chance to.

[Assassination approach: Intrigue, 76+21=97 vs 78+5+10(Paranoia)=93.]

Durnash isn't looking out for you, but his paranoia over possible assassination attempts from his followers is just as obstructing as if he was. Hours tick by as he firmly ensconces himself within corners, bolts from room to room at sudden runs instead of moving with any kind of predictability, and even though he sticks to populated and well-lit areas he bellows threateningly at any Orc that looks like it might get within arm's length. Eventually, you're forced to discard the possibility of killing him quietly due to the time constraint, and just focus on being able to make a swift getaway.

[Subtlety discarded: Martial, 95+23=118 vs 50+20=70.]

You're shrouded in Doppelganger, Take No Heed, and Ranald's Coin, but though he sees you as an Orc and he can't distinguish you as a specific rival, he's raising his weapon at your approach anyway. It doesn't matter. Branulhune snips the club neatly in two and passes through to do the same to Durnash's neck. As the Warboss' head bounces wetly across the stone, a dozen sets of eyes fix on you in an instant, and Ranald's Coin can no longer take effect and Take No Heed wavers and collapses as you so thoroughly draw attention to yourself. With your only remaining concealment being the Doppelganger form of an Orc that your students slew hours ago, you dart off at full speed, hopefully before anyone can react.

[Leg it: 42+20(Aethyric tirelessness)=62 vs 57+10(Orcish endurance)=67.]

In an irritating echo of your assassination of the Warboss of Karag Lhune, your pursuers remain doggedly at your heel, even after a hasty cast of Aethyric Armour keeps you from flagging. Your pursuers are no doubt motivated by the desire to be the one that killed the one that killed the Warboss rather than any disagreement with your act, but the result is the same and you start to look for methods beyond sheer speed to shake your pursuers.

[Casting on the run: Learning, 32+26=58 vs 16]

As a rule, greenskins very rarely properly illuminate their underground homes, and in the space between one torch and another some very quick spellwork has you slip into the shadow. You press yourself against a wall - Substance of Shadow makes you incorporeal but you'd still rather not have Orcs running through you if you can avoid it - and let your pursuers charge past, and by the time they realize they've lost sight of you, you've slipped away into the Hold.

---

[Anton rounding up mercenaries: 35]
[Anton getting in touch with a pen-pal: 51]
[Anton convincing Asarnil: 56 vs 71]
[One roll for Dogs of War: 2. Braganza's Besiegers.]
[Other, less notable sellswords: 80]

To your considerable surprise, Anton's ability to regularly produce miracles seems to have failed him, and he wasn't able to convince Asarnil to make an appearance, apparently being outbid by Tzar Vladimir Bokha of Kislev. On top of this, he's returned with only a single regiment of Dogs of War. Has the Baron of Blutdorf lost his silver tongue? Apparently not entirely, you note, as although only the heavily-armoured pavise crossbowmen of Tilea are worth noting, Anton seems to have depopulated a significant portion of the Border Princes by circulating tales of Dwarven generosity. What they lack in skill and discipline they make up for in numbers and value, as it doesn't take all that much Dwarven generosity to outbid the rugged and hostile landscape of the Border Princes.

With the day of Ranger rampaging drawing to a close, you once more return to King Belegar's side as the next stage of the battle is planned. You bask in the grumbling of those present once you tell them that once more you've accounted for a Warboss, but after that there's little debate to be had here, as the only decisions are who will be poured into Karagril and who will be kept in reserve. The order quickly shakes out as the various sellswords first, then the Throng of Karak Azul, then the Throng of Karak Eight Peaks. The Winter Wolves, the Ulrikadrin, and all ranged combatants will be remaining outside to fight off any intervention from the other Karags. Ideally the ranged combatants will fire from the Citadel, but if needed they'll move to support the other defenders in the Caldera. And not least of all, the two tallest towers of the Citadel have been claimed by the present Runelords and their two Anvils.

Your only decisions are where you, your students, and your hirelings will be during the coming battle.


Mathilde
[ ] MATHILDE: Join the sellswords, who will be going in first.
[ ] MATHILDE: Join the Throng of Karak Azul, who will be going in second.
[ ] MATHILDE: On dispel duty for Karagril, avoiding combat and watching for any hostile magics.
[ ] MATHILDE: Infiltrate Karagril early, and rampage through enemy lines once battle begins.
[ ] MATHILDE: Infiltrate Karagril early, and pick off any competent leaders.
[ ] MATHILDE: Stay in reserve just outside Karagril, to respond to anything unexpected in the mountain or the caldera.
[ ] MATHILDE: Join the Winter Wolves, who have travelled from Ulrikadrin to dominate the caldera.
[ ] MATHILDE: Stay in reserve in the Citadel, to be ready to rebuff hostile forces or magics from other Karags.

Ducklings
[ ] DUCKLINGS: Kept together and going into Karagril with the Dwarves.
[ ] DUCKLINGS: Kept together and firing from the Citadel.
[ ] DUCKLINGS: Split up and placed with units going into Karagril.
[ ] DUCKLINGS: Split up and placed with units firing from the Citadel.
[ ] DUCKLINGS: Remaining by your side.

Maximilian
[ ] MAX: Firing from the Citadel.
[ ] MAX: Firing from a gyrocopter.
[ ] MAX: On dispel duty for Karagril.
[ ] MAX: On dispel duty for the caldera.
[ ] MAX: Remaining by your side.

Johann
[ ] JOHANN: Joining the siege weapon teams.
[ ] JOHANN: Fighting in melee in Karagril.
[ ] JOHANN: On dispel duty for Karagril.
[ ] JOHANN: On dispel duty for the caldera.
[ ] JOHANN: Remaining by your side.

Panoramia
[*] With the Halflings, should they be deployed.


Finally, there's the matter of Ranald's Coin. With the year coming to a close, you could leave it as is and save it for the events of the coming months, or you could change it now.

[ ] Set it to the Gambler for the coming battle.
The Gambler doesn't work so well for second-to-second events, but it could have an influence on the strategic level. If this is chosen, you will not have Ranald's Coin for the coming turn.
[ ] Set it to the Protector, so that all will know your exploits.
It's likely that most in the Karak will hear of your deeds anyway, but this will make it so that everyone knows everything you do in their service. The Coin will remain set to the Protector for the coming turn.
[ ] Leave it untouched.
The Night Prowler will remain in effect. You will be able to select a new face as normal in the coming turn.


- Panoramia is not in your employ or your tutelage, so she had made her own decision.
- If you wish for the Ducklings to be split up so that some will be ranged and some will be melee, or just want finer control over which units exactly, make a write-in specifying who goes where.
- Write-ins are acceptable for any of the above, except Panoramia.
- I can't think of any use for the Deceiver that's more powerful than the other faces of the Coin, but if you can think of a way to make it work for you, write it in.
- This will not be plan voting, but seeking consensus would be a good idea. There will be a two hour voting moratorium.
