    <h2>The Battle of Karagril, Part 5</h2>


Spoiler



[*] The mercenaries should join the fight against Skaven.
[*] Treasure Hunt



Belegar trusts you and you can more or less speak with the authority of the Empire, but you hold your tongue. The Conspiracy of Silence is durable enough that a few Border Prince mercenaries telling stories of rat-like beastmen isn't going to undo it, especially after you have a quiet but intense word with the survivors.

Whatever bad blood there once was between Johann and Maximilian must have evaporated, or perhaps the latter is too upset to pass up a shoulder to cry on, as Maximilian bemoans the battle that never was from the eastern edge of the caldera, where the gyrocopters have landed to preserve fuel but still be on hand and the siege weapon teams have stood down from full readiness. Your rescue of him comes at Johann's thinly-veiled relief, and as the two of you make your way back into the Citadel, Maximilian turns his woes on the cannoneers, who seem equally disappointed.

Johann doesn't have the ability to summon a magical horse, but you're quite shocked to learn that he doesn't need one to keep pace with you. Enchanted gold, it seems, not only makes him stronger and tougher - it also removes his capacity to feel physical fatigue. He's not at all out of breath when you reach Karagril and dismiss your steed, nor, now that you watch closely, is he breathing at all, except when required for speech. "It's one of the most recent things I had done," he says casually as the two of you make your way deeper under the mountain. "I've a gift for the more literal applications of the Wind of Metal, but it's still quite a tricky ritual under the best of circumstances, and trying to convince yourself to inhale molten gold isn't the best of circumstances. But it does mean that I don't need to breathe."

"Useful," you comment, keeping envy out of your voice. It's a fact of life when dealing with members of other Colleges that they'll have access to capabilities that would be astoundingly useful; you can only imagine how infuriating it must be to someone who doesn't have their own suite of magical abilities to comfort themselves.

"I've got a number of flasks and bombs to take advantage of it with, but it is restricted to solo adventures. For now, anyway. I hope to find one of those Skryre gas-rats and figure out how their masks work."

The conversation fades away as you approach the Grand Avenue, the portion of the Underway that links all the Karags of the Karak. Just south of east, the Avenue leads to Karag Lhune, and to the fortified position blocking any outside entry to the Dwarf-held portions of the Avenue. Just south of west, the Avenue leads to Karag Zilfin and Clan Skryre. Both these pathways are quiet for now. Less quiet is the Avenue leading south, and currently hosting a stream of desperate Clan Mors attackers seeking to overcome a distracted Clan Moulder, who hold the territory both to the north and below, filling the maze of exhausted mineral veins and natural caverns that the Dwarves of the past knew and the Skaven-excavated tunnels below that, which the Dwarves never suspected until it was too late. And somewhere further north, on the other side of Clan Moulder, the Red Fang Orcs of Karak Drazh seek to reconnect with their former outpost of Karagril, unknowing or uncaring that they're far too late.

Clan Moulder had been about to pour upwards before the twin assault took advantage of their distraction, and above you mercenaries are having Skaven explained to them by Rangers and by some of the Tileans among them. Somewhere between thirty minutes to an hour from now, two Throngs would have finished purging Karagril and will point their fury downwards, and if all goes according to plan, Clan Moulder's presence in Karak Eight Peaks will cease to exist not long after that. Not a lot of time for an opportunistic raid, but you'll make it work.

[Infiltration: 87+21=108.]
[Moulder vs Red Fang: ???]
[Moulder vs Mors: 18+15(relative strength)=33 vs 49.]

It's been some time since you've had to infiltrate somewhere without being able to use Ulgu to cut corners, but blazing a trail for Johann makes it clear your skills are just as keen as ever and you easily slip past the roaring, screeching din of Skaven-on-Skaven battlefields and on-edge guard posts into the unprotected underbelly of Clan Moulder, normally swarming with activity but practically deserted with most fighting, some hiding, and more than a few having fled. You're also able to gauge the battles you saw while slipping past, and while Moulder does seem to have the advantage in strength it seems that Mors' desperation is enough to tip things in their favour so far, even before Dwarven intervention.

[Looting: Intrigue, 97+21=118. One roll in each category.]

"What in Teclis' name is an Elf doing here?" Johann says, standing over the unexpected figure's senseless form.

"Nothing good, I'd wager," you reply, looking past him into the being's quarters. The door was unlocked and the furnishings inside bordered on decadent, so you're pretty sure he's not a prisoner. You reach past Johann and gather Ulgu in your palm, and a touch and a thought plunges the elf into a deathlike torpor. "We'll take him with us and question him later."

"You speak elf?"

"You don't?"

Instead of responding Johann drags the unconscious figure inside and closes the door, and the two of you begin to search the room, your attention quickly going to the chest on a writing desk, which reveals the gleam of gold when opened.

"Why are they pink?" you wonder aloud, running your fingers through the coins.

"Lustrian gold?" Johann suggests.

"How would they have gotten here?" You see a language you recognize and pick one up. "Port Reaver. Okay, it must be. Are there Skaven in Lustria?"

"No idea," Johann says, picking a coin up and rubbing it between two golden fingers. "Jewellers call it 'rose gold' when they're trying to bilk a noble. Feels about a quarter copper, maybe less."

"Maybe our new friend had a previous career as a pirate." You hesitate, thinking of the Bursar, but this definitely falls into the category of fish jumping aboard. Johann gives up on suppressing the sparks from the shock-whip he was examining, and rolls it in the elf's bedsheet as you turn your attention to the axe mounted above the desk. It's definitely Dwarven, so you place it atop the chest.

A shelf of books attracts your attention, but you quickly realize they aren't reference material, but instead somewhat like your usual recreational reading but with the risque cranked up to the point where it's definitely obscene and possibly blasphemous. Your searches don't reveal anything else of interest, so the two of you move on.

"A laboratory," Johann says, his voice thick with disgust.

"I've seen laboratories. I've got a laboratory. This is an abattoir." You grimace at a rack of still-bloody instruments, and with trepidation lean over the wide metal drum splattered with old blood. But instead of a pile of gore and viscera, you see inside a strange, faintly-glowing ooze. You frown at it, and select the cleanest of the implements to give it a poke; it clings onto the tool but relinquishes its grip when you shake it, and you see the gore has been cleaned off it. You uncork a flask of blood and pour it in, and watch as it soaks into the ooze, and then with a set of clamps and a lot of care, you gather up a flaskful of it for future investigation.

You add it to the 'take' pile next to what look like a set of microscopes that Johann's collected, and then you venture into one of the two back rooms. To your complete lack of surprise, the room is full of individually-caged Skaven test subjects, some bearing fresh wounds of the butchery Moulder call surgery, some seemingly dead, and some so far untouched. A few, seemingly feral or starving, throw themselves at the bars in a fruitless attempt to attack you, but most stare warily at you, trying to decide if you represent some new hell or a faint hope. Part of you wants to uncage them, but Skaven nature being what it is they'd likely as not attack you, and even if they didn't they'd still end up food for Clan Mors or sport for the Red Fang Orcs. You turn from them and instead examine the haphazard pile of books next to a stained dissection table. Most appear to be lab notes, badly-bound and the handwriting barely legible, but tucked into a corner you find a well-bound (in leather, and you try not to imagine the source) tome that when opened displays grisly anatomical charts of Dwarves. Or so you initially thought, but each depiction of their head or skull shows prominent tusks and a few show horns, and as the book continues it starts to depict some sort of Dwarf-centaur. These must be the Chaos Dwarves, that the Dwarves you know are so reticent to speak of.

The caged Skaven seemed to grow confident from your lack of threatening moves, and start to chitter what you assume to be Queekish entreaties at you, and with an effort of will you ignore their pleas.  But just before you turn to leave, you hear the last thing you expected from a Skaven mouth. "Umgi! Elgramraki anokrit umgi! Orbarazar!" You stare at the Skaven that had spoken, managing to keep shock from showing on your face. With your attention on it you see this one is larger than the others, both taller and more muscular, and the injuries it bears seem deliberate cruelty rather than the casual cruelty of Moulder experimentation. "Orbarazar!" it repeats.

You consider the Skaven. The creatures are known to be untrustworthy, but that their society even exists is proof that intimidation works, and you feel confident that you could sufficiently intimidate a solitary prisoner. Despite the best efforts of a few of the Grey Order, there's yet to be any success in translating the language of the ratmen, but with a common language you might be the one to change that. You make your mind up. "Ip. Afthagit, afuzkul." The Skaven nods rapidly in agreement to your threat, and you gather Ulgu once more and press your hand against the bars. It stares at your hand curiously, and cautiously extends its paw to touch it at a jerk of your head, and then slumps into the torpor of Mockery of Death.

When you carry your new cargo back out, Johann's already finished with the other room and along with a chest full of unknown vials, he has also found a rodent cargo of his own. You give the sleeping wolf-rat pups a dubious look, but considering the actual Skaven you're carrying, you're not in any position to criticize. With the din of combat growing louder in three directions your time is running low, and you use Substance of Shadow to stash your inert goods inside a wall for later retrieval and the two of you start hauling your prisoners, biological samples, and possibly biological samples back up to friendly territory.

With the stated intent of a punitive raid, the Throngs disengaged just after Clan Moulder started crumpling, and from what they saw Clan Mors barely managed to beat the Red Fang Orcs to the previously-Moulder territory, sparking the first of what is likely to be a constant war of attrition between the two. Without Dwarven intervention it seems the Orcs would have beaten Clan Mors, and would no doubt have swept upwards to seek their lost outpost and then to seek to reconquer it. Those that lost their lives raiding Clan Moulder saved even more lives, as instead of revanchist Orcs, the Karagril front is likely to be a cautious and unspoken detente with the outcast Skaven.

As the Throngs march back to the Citadel and construction begins on the Karagril fortifications and the Silver Tarn aqueduct, you and Johann consider your haul. Neither of you are exactly short of study material, but nor are either of you eager to give away what could be amazing discoveries, and the two of you carefully consider each one and discuss what is to be done.


Any options chosen except 'claim' and 'cede' will split any favour or money gained evenly with Johann. You may claim one more item than you cede if you assert your position of authority, claim and cede even amounts if you wish to be equitable to your fellow Magister, and may cede more than you claim if you're feeling generous.

First, an out-of-place and suspected Naggarothi Elf. He seemed to be a guest or a partner of Clan Moulder, which raises all sorts of questions. You should be able to interrogate him, as Druhir and Eltharin are said to be mutually intelligible, but you're not entirely confident of your ability to usefully interrogate one of the Druchii. You're also not sure if he speaks Queekish or if the Skaven spoke Druhir.
[ ] ELF: Extradite him to Ulthuan. (+???)
[ ] ELF: Ransom him to Naggaroth. (+wealth?)
[ ] ELF: Send him to the Emperor's Spymaster for questioning. (+???)
[ ] ELF: Send him to the Grey College for questioning. (+College favour)
[ ] ELF: Claim him.
[ ] ELF: Cede him.

Second, a Skaven that spoke Khazalid. He promised to serve you, and though you don't trust his word you trust your ability to intimidate, and through the shared language you might be able to piece together Queekish - as well as question him for any other knowledge he might have.
[ ] SKAVEN: Send him to the Grey College for questioning. (+College favour)
[ ] SKAVEN: Hand him over to the Dwarves for questioning. (+Dwarf favour)
[ ] SKAVEN: Claim him.
[ ] SKAVEN: Cede him.

Your third live capture, a litter of wolf-rat pups. They're inquisitive and playful, and happily eat just about anything. Johann seems quite taken with them. Looking through your eyes, Wolf seems very confused.
[ ] PUPS: Sell them to the Imperial Zoo. (+wealth)
[ ] PUPS: Send them to the Amber College. (+College favour)
[ ] PUPS: Claim them.
[ ] PUPS: Cede them.

Your fourth subject, also disturbingly living, a sample of some sort of ooze that was either growing in or being used as a Moulder surgeon's waste bin. It clings to anything that prods it, and if it's biological and doesn't put up a fight, it digests it.
[ ] OOZE: Destroy it.
[ ] OOZE: Sell it to the Imperial Zoo. (+wealth)
[ ] OOZE: Send it to any College that will take it. (+College favour?)
[ ] OOZE: Claim it.
[ ] OOZE: Cede it.

The fifth is simple: a Rune-axe that causes Kragg to double take, stare at it intently, and then grab it and beeline towards his workshop, muttering thoughtfully. The only real question is who gets the credit from the Dwarves for whatever the discovery ends up being.
[ ] AXE: Split it.
[ ] AXE: Claim it.
[ ] AXE: Cede it.

The sixth is a strange one - a book on the anatomy of Chaos Dwarves. The Queekish is untranslated, but the many extremely detailed diagrams speak for themselves. Little is known about the Chaos Dwarves, but they are unquestionably enemies of both the Empire and the Karaz Ankor.
[ ] BOOK: Sell it to the Imperial Army. (+wealth)
[ ] BOOK: Send it to the Colleges. (+College favour)
[ ] BOOK: Hand it over to the Dwarves. (Dwarf favour)
[ ] BOOK: Claim it.
[ ] BOOK: Cede it.

And finally, a chest of Lustrian gold. Exact valuation will require assaying, but you estimate about two thousand coins and Johann placed them at about 75% purity.
[ ] GOLD: Split it.
[ ] GOLD: Claim it.
[ ] GOLD: Cede it.

There's enough microscopes for you and Johann to simply take some each. The lightning whip and the chest of vials of unknown liquids aren't quite interesting enough to be decided immediately, and have instead gone into the growing pile of to-be-studied Skaven miscellany that you and Johann share.


- As the claim/cede balance is quite important, voting will be in plan format. There will be a two hour voting moratorium.
- With thanks to everyone who made suggestions for the loot table.
- Next update will have the tower/purchases votes.
