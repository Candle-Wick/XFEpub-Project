+<i>To The End, Always+</i></b>​</div><div style="text-align: left">"Very good, the shipyards shall burn bright with the glory of our fulfilled pact," Phokas stated flatly, his mechanized voice squawking oddly on the last word, "The Thunderhawks will be produced quickly, the larger vessels will take a little more time. Worry not, they shall be ready, however, with priority status."<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel shifted the part of his face capable of it into raising an eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
"So quickly?"<br/>
<br/>
A harsh rude noise emanated from the techpriest's vocoder, akin to two voices either laughing or snorting at the same time. The shifting mechadendrites writhed with no discernible purpose for a moment before stilling and folding back in upon themselves.<br/>
<br/>
"You have brought us much, Chapter Master," Phokas bowed his head slightly, "This has only been the latest in a remarkable string of recent victories and gains for the Omnissiah, all won with if not the entire strength of the Blood Ravens, then at least your crucial aid. Besides which," the techpriest shrugged and spoke with a faint echo of slyness, "We have been the premier shipbuilding site for the entire sector for thousands of years. The Imperial Navy requires cruisers aplenty, always. Frigates, hallowed be their own designs and requirements, are not nearly so...demanding upon the forges."<br/>
<br/>
Which, in truth, Gabriel knew to be fair. It was all the better that he had not spoken of the more forbidding Novas, for their very existence remained yet a controversy between space marine and Navy. Far better to resupply their so terribly depleted fleet in this manner than another.<br/>
<br/>
"As towards your other request...," he murmured, thoughts flashing, "A moment."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course," Phokas nodded, a pair of servo skulls arriving almost immediately carrying dataslates for him to work on.<br/>
<br/>
He turned away, hand going to the vox.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother-Captain Tarkus. I have a task which has requested of us."<br/>
<br/>
"I will do it," Tarkus replied without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel allowed a small smile to cross his lips for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
"Very well. The 5th Company shall remain with the spoils during their study, the better to protect them against the eldar should they dare to show their faces once more."<br/>
<br/>
There was no immediate reply, and yet for all that Gabriel could <i>feel</i> the hatred practically billowing across the vox.<br/>
<br/>
"The 5th Company shall stand, and should the xeno attempt to destroy us, it is <i>they</i> who shall fall," Tarkus growled.<br/>
<br/>
"Very good. May none find you wanting, Tarkus."<br/>
<br/>
Only then did he turn back to Phokas, whose sheer amount of enhancements had to have ensured he heard the conversation. At the least, he either possessed the decorum to have kept his attention on his work, or was simply that focused. Still, by the time that Gabriel advanced, he finished his work and sent the servo skulls flitting away on some other duty.<br/>
<br/>
"The 5th Company's Captain Tarkus is known to us. A fortuitous confluence of hatred, Chapter Master. We give thanks to your continued generosity."<br/>
<br/>
Nodding to the techpriest, their business done, he turned away for his own transport, Phokas quickly returning to his own business and heading away. It was a sign of great respect and acknowledgement that the Fabricator-General of an entire Forge World came to speak in person to him, rather than some subordinate. Their fleet would be greatly restored with this, though not yet at full strength to be sure, but mightier indeed. For a moment, Gabriel let him feel the faintest flickering embers of hope, those that he kept hidden deep within, burn just a bit brighter at the news. Even now, after all these years, he could feel the insidious voice of his old friend whisper to him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, Gabriel. Or have you forgotten?</i><br/>
<br/>
Yet, for a wonder, it was old. Decrepit. Thinned by years of further hardening, of survival, of victory again and again over the forces of Chaos, hard-won as always. Isador's specter had no hold on him. Not any longer. And in that realization, Gabriel strode forth with renewed purpose, that which had hung over his shoulder for so long finally fading out entirely.<br/>
<br/>
His work as Chapter Master was not yet done.<br/>
<br/>
But this was a good step.<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: center">======================================<br/>​</div><div style="text-align: left">As the galaxy churned, so did the Chapter. And with their fury meted out against the foe, they turned to building instead. Within the Librarium, yet more fragments of the fallen Avatars of Khaine were lashed together under the blazing soul-forges into new forms, the will of the Blood Ravens warping the physical realm and the beyond to do what was needed. Elsewhere, within the forges, armor for the precious new blood of the Chapter was built in great number. Under the stern eye of Martellus, this dire task, whose importance was only magnified by the losses taken in the recent battles, was performed admirably. Less admirably was the construction of a set of armor intended for the captain of the 10th Company. It had, perhaps, held the potential to hold the advanced stealth capabilities of another set of relic armor, and yet the imitation failed. A lack of materials, created with the precision demanded of their specific design, was to blame. Taxed as the forges were by the rest of their construction efforts, it was not something that could be truly blamed on the lessers to the Master of the Forge. Not that this stopped Martellus from bellowing at them loud enough to be heard through bulkheads.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at one point, someone dropped a spanner in the Howling Hatred, which technically improved its nearness towards having a true forge of its own, in the most infinitesimal of ways.<br/>

All across the fleet, the Chapter turned inwards as time stretched on, repairs allowing them the time to improve themselves as much as they could. Apollo, his time with Gabriel having been honing for them both, was sent to the rest of his brothers. His shamed burned bright, but his skill brighter, and the Blood Ravens found their skill increasing, if by nothing more than sheer necessity. For no matter Apollo's own mental state, he remained yet a champion in hand to hand combat. Simply to keep up demanded they improve themselves. The same was with Hannibal, whose tests of strength grew ever more tiring, straining, and so too did they grow stronger. Elsewhere, Hadrian, healed more than enough from his wounds, demanded trialed combat at long range, medium range, and close range, the only weapons allowed being the variety of ranged weaponry at hand. All with training in mind, of course. Though the various apothecaries did not particularly care for the routine march of wounded marines that occurred almost daily.<br/>
<br/>
And elsewhere, Gabriel sighed through augmetic lungs as Cyrus watched the target through his rifle's scope.<br/>
<br/>
"You are improving."<br/>
<br/>
"Glacially," Gabriel growled.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes," Cyrus replied simply, shrugging, drawing a bemused look from his Chapter Master.<br/>
<br/>
"I was never a true savant with the bolter amongst the rest of my brothers, even when I was but a tactical marine," he muttered, kneeling again to fire down the private training area's lane towards the rapidly shifting targets. "And even now, after all these years, I have not yet returned to where I once managed."<br/>
<br/>
"And yet you are striving to improve. If only all my scouts and initiates could remain as such once they left the 10th Company."<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel snorted, and continued to let loose another burst. For an average human, it would be incredible. For a space marine...as of yet still frustratingly average. None knew of what they did here, and that alone was some small balm to his pride. As for Cyrus...the man knew the value of discretion well enough.<br/>
